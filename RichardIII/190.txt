Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent—Look back! Defend thee! Here are enemies.God and our innocence defend and guard us!Be patient. They are friends, Ratcliffe and Lovell.Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.So dear I loved the man that I must weep.I took him for the plainest harmless creatureThat breathed upon this earth a Christian;Made him my book, wherein my soul recordedThe history of all her secret thoughts.So smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtueThat, his apparent open guilt omitted—I mean his conversation with Shore’s wife—He lived from all attainder of suspects.Well, well, he was the covert’st sheltered traitorThat ever lived.—Would you imagine, or almost believe,Were ’t not that by great preservationWe live to tell it, that subtle traitorThis day had plotted, in the council houseTo murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?Had he done so?#LBSFORGOLDLord Mayor, the reason we have sent—Look behind you! Defend yourself! There are enemies here.God defend and guard us innocents against them!Stay calm. They’re friends—Ratcliffe and Lovell.Here’s the head of that notorious traitor, the dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.I loved this man so much it makes me weep. I took him to be the plainest, most harmless Christian on earth. He was the book in which I recorded all of my most secret thoughts. He was so slick in covering over his plans that if it hadn’t been for his love affair with Shore’s wife, I would never have suspected him.Well, well, he was the most covert traitor who ever lived. Would you believe, if we hadn’t caught him, this subtle traitor would have murdered the Lord of Gloucester and me in the council room today?He would have?
