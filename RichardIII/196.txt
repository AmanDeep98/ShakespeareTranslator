Doubt not, my lord. I’ll play the oratorAs if the golden fee for which I pleadWere for myself. And so, my lord, adieu.If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard’s Castle,Where you shall find me well accompaniedWith reverend fathers and well-learnèd bishops.I go; and towards three or four o'clockLook for the news that the Guildhall affords.Go, Lovell, with all speed to Doctor Shaw.
(to RATCLIFFE) Go thou to Friar Penker. Bid them bothMeet me within this hour at Baynard’s Castle.Now will I go to take some privy orderTo draw the brats of Clarence out of sight,And to give order that no manner of personHave any time recourse unto the princes.#LBSFORGOLDDon’t worry, my lord, I’ll be as eloquent as if the golden crown I’m pleading for were for myself. Goodbye, my lord.If things go well, bring the crowd to Baynard’sBaynard’s Castle was another of Richard’s London estates.Baynard’s Castle, where I’ll be surrounded by priests and learned bishops.I’m off. Around three or four o'clock, look for news from the meeting hall.Lovell, go as fast as you can to Doctor Shaw. (to RATCLIFFE) Go to Friar Penker. Both of you, tell these men to meet me in less than an hour at Baynard’s Castle.Now I’ll go inside and write out a secret order to keep Clarence’s brats out of sight and to forbid anyone whatsoever from seeing King Edward’s sons.
