Accursèd and unquiet wrangling days,How many of you have mine eyes beheld?My husband lost his life to get the crown,And often up and down my sons were tossedFor me to joy, and weep, their gain and loss.And being seated, and domestic broilsClean overblown, themselves the conquerorsMake war upon themselves, brother to brother,Blood to blood, self against self. O, preposterousAnd frantic outrage, end thy damnèd spleen,Or let me die, to look on death no more.
