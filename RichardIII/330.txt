He looks in an almanac
Who saw the sun today?Not I, my lord.Then he disdains to shine, for by the bookHe should have braved the east an hour agoA black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliffe!My lord.The sun will not be seen today.The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.I would these dewy tears were from the ground.Not shine today? Why, what is that to meMore than to Richmond, for the selfsame heavenThat frowns on me looks sadly upon him.#LBSFORGOLDWhat did Northumberland say about Richmond?That he was never trained as a soldier.That’s true. And what did Surrey say to that?He smiled and said, “The better for us.”He’s right, and that’s how it is.Read the time there. Give me an almanac. (looking in an almanac) Did anyone see the sun today?I didn’t, my lord.Then it refuses to shine. According to this almanac, it should have risen an hour ago. It’ll be a black day for somebody today. Ratcliffe!My lord?The sun will not appear today. The sky frowns and scowls on our army. I wish there wasn’t so much dew on the ground. So, the sun won’t shine today! Well, why should that be worse for me than it is for Richmond? The same heaven that’s frowning on me looks gloomily on him.
