Have patience, madam. There’s no doubt his majestyWill soon recover his accustomed health.In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse.Therefore, for God’s sake, entertain good comfortAnd cheer his grace with quick and merry eyes.If he were dead, what would betide on me?No other harm but loss of such a lord.The loss of such a lord includes all harms.The heavens have blessed you with a goodly sonTo be your comforter when he is gone.Ah, he is young, and his minorityIs put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,A man that loves not me nor none of you.Is it concluded that he shall be Protector?It is determined, not concluded yet;But so it must be if the king miscarry.#LBSFORGOLDBe patient, madam. I’m sure his majesty will recover his health soon.You’ll only make him worse with all your worry. For God’s sake, let people comfort you. Then you’ll be able to cheer him up.If he were dead, what would happen to me?Nothing more than that you’d lose your husband.Losing this husband will cause me all sorts of harm.You have been blessed with an excellent son, who will comfort you when the king is dead.But he’s young, and as long as he’s too young to become king, Richard, the duke of Gloucester, has power over him. Richard loves neither me nor any of you.Has it been decided that Richard will be ProtectorA “Protector” acted for a king until he was old enough to rule on his own.Protector?It’s been decided, though not yet officially announced. But that’s what will happen if the king dies.
