If all this will not do,I’ll drown you in the malmsey butt within.A bloody deed, and desperately dispatched.How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my handsOf this most grievous murder.How now? What mean’st thou, that thou help’st me not?By heavens, the duke shall know how slack you have been.I would he knew that I had saved his brother.Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say,For I repent me that the duke is slain.#LBSFORGOLDNo, sticking to your plan is beastly, savage, devilish.
