(to QUEEN ELIZABETH)
Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hateUpon your Grace, but with all duteous loveDoth cherish you and yours, God punish meWhen I have most need to employ a friend,With hate in those where I expect most love.And most assurèd that he is a friend,Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guileBe he unto me: this do I beg of GodWhen I am cold in love to you or yours.A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.There wanteth now our brother Gloucester hereTo make the blessèd period of this peace.And in good time,Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliffe and the duke.Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen,And, princely peers, a happy time of day.Happy indeed, as we have spent the day.Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity,Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,Between these swelling, wrong-incensèd peers.#LBSFORGOLD
(to QUEEN ELIZABETH) If I ever turn my hatred toward your majesty, and do not love and cherish you and yours, may God punish me. May I find hatred where I most expect love. When I most need a friend, and when I’m sure I have one, make him treacherous and deceitful to me. I beg God to do all this whenever I fail to show love to you or yours.Noble Buckingham, your promise is like medicine to my ailing heart. All we need to put the final touches on this future peace is for Richard to appear.And just in time, here he comes with Sir Richard Ratcliffe.Good morning to my sovereign king and queen. Noble peers, how nice to see you.Happy indeed, the way we have spent the day. Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity, turning enmity into peace and hate into love among these mistakenly angry nobles.
