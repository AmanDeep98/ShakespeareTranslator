We have not yet set down this day of triumph.Tomorrow, in my judgement, is too sudden,For I myself am not so well providedAs else I would be, were the day prolonged.Where is my lord the duke of Gloucester?I have sent for these strawberries.His grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning.There’s some conceit or other likes him wellWhen that he bids good morrow with such spirit.I think there’s never a man in ChristendomCan lesser hide his love or hate than he,For by his face straight shall you know his heart.What of his heart perceive you in his faceBy any livelihood he showed today?Marry, that with no man here he is offended,For were he, he had shown it in his looks.I pray God he be not, I say.I pray you all, tell me what they deserveThat do conspire my death with devilish plotsOf damnèd witchcraft, and that have prevailedUpon my body with their hellish charms?#LBSFORGOLDWe have not yet set the coronation day. Tomorrow, in my opinion, is too soon. I myself am not as well-equipped as I would be if the day were put off a bit.Where is my lord, the duke of Gloucester? I have sent for the strawberries.Richard is looking cheerful today. You always know he’s got some plan that pleases him when he says good morning with such gusto. I don’t think there’s a man under the sun who’s worse at hiding his love or hate than Richard. You know his feelings immediately just by looking at his face.And what feelings did you see in his face today?That he’s not angry with anyone here. If he were, he would have shown it.I pray to God he isn’t.Tell me, all of you, what punishment does a person deserve who conspires to kill me with witchcraft and who has already plagued my body with black magic?
