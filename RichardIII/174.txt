Sir Richard Ratcliffe, let me tell thee this:Today shalt thou behold a subject dieFor truth, for duty, and for loyalty.
(to RATCLIFFE)
God bless the prince from all the pack of you!A knot you are of damnèd bloodsuckers.
(to RATCLIFFE) You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter.Dispatch. The limit of your lives is out.O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,Fatal and ominous to noble peers!Within the guilty closure of thy walls,Richard the Second here was hacked to death,And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.Now Margaret’s curse is fall'n upon our heads,When she exclaimed on Hastings, you, and I,For standing by when Richard stabbed her son.Then cursed she Richard, then cursed she Buckingham.Then cursed she Hastings. O, remember, God,To hear her prayer for them, as now for us!And for my sister and her princely sons,Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,Which, as thou know’st, unjustly must be spilt.#LBSFORGOLDSir Richard Ratcliffe, let me tell you this. Today you will witness a person die for truth, duty, and loyality.
(to RATCLIFFE) God protect the prince from all of you. You’re a group of damned bloodsuckers!
(to RATCLIFFE) You’ll live to regret this.Hurry up. Your lives are over.Oh, Pomfret, Pomfret! Oh, you bloody prison, fatal and threatening to noble lords! Within these guilty walls, Richard II was hacked to death. And now, to add more blood to its name, we’re losing our innocent lives here.Now Margaret’s curse has fallen on our heads, for standing by and doing nothing when Richard stabbed her son.She cursed Richard then. She cursed Buckingham then. She cursed Hastings then. Oh God, remember to hear her prayer for them, just as for us! But don’t kill my sister and her royal sons, be satisfied, dear God, with our blood, which is being spilled unjustly, as you know.
