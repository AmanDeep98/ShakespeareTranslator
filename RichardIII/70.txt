Madam, his majesty doth call for you,—And for your Grace, —and yours, my gracious lords.Catesby, I come. —Lords, will you go with me?We wait upon your Grace.I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.The secret mischiefs that I set abroachI lay unto the grievous charge of others.Clarence, whom I indeed have cast in darkness,I do beweep to many simple gulls,Namely, to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham,And tell them ’tis the queen and her alliesThat stir the king against the duke my brother.Now they believe it and withal whet meTo be revenged on Rivers, Dorset, Grey;But then I sigh and, with a piece of scripture,Tell them that God bids us do good for evil;And thus I clothe my naked villainyWith odd old ends stolen out of Holy Writ,And seem a saint when most I play the devil.But, soft! here come my executioners.—How now, my hardy, stout, resolvèd mates?Are you now going to dispatch this thing?We are, my lord, and come to have the warrantThat we may be admitted where he is.#LBSFORGOLDMadam, his majesty asks for you, and for you, Duke of Gloucester, and for you, my noble lords.Catesby, we’ll be there soon.—Lords, will you come with me?We will wait on you, your majesty.Incredible. I do the wrong and am the first to start quarrels. What I did in secret I blame on others. I cry about Clarence, whom I had imprisoned, in front of these simple fools—namely, Hastings, Derby and Buckingham—and tell them that the queen and her allies roused the king against my brother Clarence. They believe me and urge me to take revenge on Rivers, Vaughan, and Grey. But then I sigh and quote a chunk of the Bible—how God says do good in return for evil. Ha! Dressing my out-and-out wickedness in scraps of Scripture, I look like a saint exactly when I’m most like the devil.But quiet. Here come the murderers I’ve hired. How’s it going, hardy, reliable friends! Are you going to take care of this thing now?We are, my lord. We’ve come to get the warrant so we can be let into his cell.
