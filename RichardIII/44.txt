Here comes the lord of Buckingham, and Derby.
(to QUEEN ELIZABETH) Good time of day unto your
royal Grace.
God make your Majesty joyful, as you have been.The countess Richmond, good my lord of Derby,To your good prayer will scarcely say amen.Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she’s your wifeAnd loves not me, be you, good lord, assuredI hate not you for her proud arrogance.I do beseech you either not believeThe envious slanders of her false accusers,Or if she be accused in true report,Bear with her weakness, which I think proceedsFrom wayward sickness and no grounded malice.Saw you the king today, my lord of Derby?But now the duke of Buckingham and IAre come from visiting his majesty.What likelihood of his amendment, lords?Madam, good hope. His grace speaks cheerfully.#LBSFORGOLDHere come Lord Buckingham and Lord Derby.
(to QUEEN ELIZABETH) Good afternoon, your royal Highness!I hope God makes you happy again, like you once were.My good Lord Derby, the countess Richmond would hardly say “amen”Before the Countess of Richmond was Stanley’s wife, she was married to Edmund Tudor. She is the mother of the earl of Richmond, the future Henry VII, who will prove to be an important character later in this play.“amen” to your kind words. But don’t worry. I don’t hold it against you, even though she’s your wife, that she’s so unfriendly and arrogant.Please don’t believe the false rumors you’ve heard about her feelings toward you, or if they’re true, then forgive her, since she’s only acting that way because she’s sick, not because she hates you.Did you see the king today, Lord Derby?Yes, the duke of Buckingham and I have just returned from visiting him.What are the chances of his getting better, lords?Madam, keep up hope. He seems cheerful.
