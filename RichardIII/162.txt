(knocking) My lord, my lord.
(within) Who knocks?One from the Lord Stanley.
(within) What is ‘t o’clock?Upon the stroke of four.Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights?So it appears by that I have to say.First, he commends him to your noble self.What then?Then certifies your Lordship that this nightHe dreamt the boar had razèd his helmBesides, he says there are two councils kept,And that may be determined at the oneWhich may make you and him to rue at th' other.Therefore he sends to know your Lordship’s pleasure,If you will presently take horse with himAnd with all speed post with him toward the northTo shun the danger that his soul divines.#LBSFORGOLD
(knocking) My lord, my lord.
(offstage) Who’s knocking?A messenger from Lord Stanley.
(offstage)What time is it?Four o'clock in the morning.Can’t Lord Stanley sleep?I guess not—for good reason, as you’ll soon hear. First, he sends his regards.And then?And then he said to tell you that tonight he dreamed the duke of Gloucester cut off his helmet—that is, his head. Besides that, he says that two meetings are going to be held tomorrow, and something may be decided at one of them that may make you and him, who are at the other, sorry. He wants to know if instead of going to the meeting, you’ll get on your horse and ride north with him to get out of harm’s way.
