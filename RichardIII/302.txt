Thus doth he force the swords of wicked menTo turn their own points in their masters' bosoms.Thus Margaret’s curse falls heavy upon my neck:“When he,” quoth she, “shall split thy heart with sorrow,Remember Margaret was a prophetess.”—Come, lead me, officers, to the block of shame.Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.#LBSFORGOLDThis is how God forces wicked men to turn their swords against themselves. Margaret’s curse has come true. “When Richard has split your heart in two with grief,” she said, “you’ll know that Margaret was a prophetess.” Come, sirs, bring me to this block of shame. I have done wrong, so I will suffer wrong. I have been blamed because I deserved to be.
