Say that I slew them not.Then say they were not slain.But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.I did not kill your husband.Why then, he is alive.Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward’s hands.In thy foul throat thou liest. Queen Margaret sawThy murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood,The which thou once didst bend against her breast,But that thy brothers beat aside the point.I was provokèd by her sland'rous tongue,That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.Thou wast provokèd by thy bloody mind,That never dream’st on aught but butcheries.Didst thou not kill this king?I grant you.Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then, God grant me tooThou mayst be damnèd for that wicked deed.O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous.The better for the King of heaven that hath him.He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither,For he was fitter for that place than earth.#LBSFORGOLDLet’s say I didn’t kill them.Then you might as well say they’re not dead. But they are dead, and you killed them, you slave of the devil.I did not kill your husband.Well, then he must be alive.No, he is dead. Edward killed him.You’re lying. Queen Margaret saw your sword steaming with his blood. It was the same sword you almost killed her with—and you would have killed her if my brothers hadn’t fought you off.She provoked me with her lying mouth, accusing me of crimes I didn’t commit.No, what provoked you was your own bloody mind, which never thinks about anything but butchering. You killed this king, didn’t you?Yes, I’ll grant you that.You’ll grant me, you hedgehog? Then let God grant me that you’ll be damned for that wicked deed. Oh, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous.That will please God, who has him now.He is in heaven, where you will never go.Let him thank me, who helped him get there. He’s better suited to be there than here.
