Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.
(to PRINCE) Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign.The weary way hath made you melancholy.No, uncle, but our crosses on the wayHave made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.I want more uncles here to welcome me.Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your yearsHath not yet dived into the world’s deceit;Nor more can you distinguish of a manThan of his outward show, which, God He knows,Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.Those uncles which you want were dangerous.Your Grace attended to their sugared wordsBut looked not on the poison of their hearts.God keep you from them, and from such false friends.God keep me from false friends, but they were none.My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.#LBSFORGOLDWelcome, sweet prince, to London, the capital of the king.Welcome, dear nephew, king of all my thoughts. The tiring journey seems to have made you gloomy.It wasn’t the journey itself, uncle, but the troubles we encountered that made it wearisome and dull. I want more uncles here to welcome me.Sweet prince, you’re just an innocent child. You don’t really understand how capable people are of trickery. All you know is what a man shows you, which has little to do with what he’s really thinking. Those uncles that you wish were here were dangerous. Your Grace heard their saccharine words, but didn’t take note of their poisonous intentions. God protect you from them and from other false friends!God should keep me from false friends, but they weren’t false.My lord, the mayor of London is here to greet you.
