Go, coward as thou art.Well, I’ll go hide the body in some holeTill that the duke give order for his burial.And when I have my meed, I will away,For this will out, and then I must not stay.#LBSFORGOLDI’m not. Go, coward that you are. Well, I’ll go hide the body in some hole until the duke gives orders for his burial. And when I get my reward, I’ll get out of here. The truth about this will come out, and I can’t stick around then.
