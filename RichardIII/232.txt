   O bitter consequenceThat Edward still should live “true noble prince”!Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull.Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead,And I would have it suddenly performed.What sayest thou now? Speak suddenly. Be brief.Your Grace may do your pleasure.Tut, tut, thou art all ice; thy kindness freezes.Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?Give me some little breath, some pause, dear lord,Before I positively speak in this.I will resolve you herein presently.
(aside to the other attendants)
The king is angry. See, he gnaws his lip.
(aside) I will converse with iron-witted foolsAnd unrespective boys. None are for meThat look into me with considerate eyes.High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.—Boy!
(coming forward) My lord?Know’st thou not any whom corrupting goldWill tempt unto a close exploit of death?#LBSFORGOLDOh, how bitter it is that Edward—the real “true, noble prince”—should still be alive! Cousin, you didn’t used to be so thickheaded. Shall I put it plainly? I want the bastards dead. And I want it done right away. What do you say? Speak now and to the point.Your Grace can do whatever he wants.Tut, tut, you’ve become rather icy. Your friendliness toward me seems to be freezing over. Tell me, do I have your consent to kill them?Give me a little breathing space, my lord, a little pause to think. I’ll let you know my answer shortly.
(so only the attendant nearest him can hear) The king is angry. See, he bites his lip.
(to himself) I only want to deal with stupid fools and careless boys. I have no use for people who look at me insightfully. Ambitious Buckingham grows much too circumspect. Boy!My lord?Do you know anyone who would kill someone for money?
