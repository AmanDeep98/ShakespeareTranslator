So now prosperity begins to mellowAnd drop into the rotten mouth of death.Here in these confines slyly have I lurkedTo watch the waning of mine enemies.A dire induction am I witness to,And will to France, hoping the consequenceWill prove as bitter, black, and tragical.Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret. Who comes here?Ah, my poor princes! Ah, my tender babes,My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets,If yet your gentle souls fly in the airAnd be not fixed in doom perpetual,Hover about me with your airy wingsAnd hear your mother’s lamentation.Hover about her; say that right for rightHath dimmed your infant morn to agèd night.So many miseries have crazed my voiceThat my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute.Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
(aside) Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet;Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.#LBSFORGOLDSo now the good times have ripened and grown rotten. I’ve lurked in the shadows here to watch the downfall of my enemies. I’ve been watching the terrible prologue to a scene that I hope will prove dark and tragic. I’ll head to France soon. It’s time to hide, wretched Margaret. Who’s coming?Ah, my poor princes! Ah, my tender babes, my flowers who didn’t even get a chance to bloom. If your gentle souls are still flying in the air and have not yet landed where they will remain forever, hover around me with your airy wings and hear your mother’s lament.Hover about her and tell her she got what she deserved, with her children dead before their time.I’ve been crazed with so many miseries that my tongue has tired of lamenting and gone mute. Edward Plantagenet, why are you dead?
(to herself) One Plantagenet pays for the other. One Edward dies to pay a debt for the other Edward who died.
