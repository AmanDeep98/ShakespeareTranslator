Who meets us here? My niece PlantagenetLed in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?Now, for my life, she’s wandering to the Tower,On pure heart’s love, to greet the tender prince.—Daughter, well met.     God give your Graces bothA happy and a joyful time of day.As much to you, good sister. Whither away?No farther than the Tower, and, as I guess,Upon the like devotion as yourselves,To gratulate the gentle princes there.Kind sister, thanks. We’ll enter all together.And in good time here the lieutenant comes.—Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,How doth the prince and my young son of York?Right well, dear madam. By your patience,I may not suffer you to visit them.The king hath strictly charged the contrary.#LBSFORGOLDWho’s this? My granddaughter, with her kind aunt, the duchess of Gloucester, leading her by the hand? Now, on my life, the young child must be headed to the Tower to greet the young princes, whom she adores. Daughter, how nice to see you.Good afternoon!The same to you, good sister. Where are you going?Just to the Tower—I’m guessing, for the same reason you are: to salute the noble princes who are staying there.Yes, kind sister. We can all go together.And here comes the warden, just in time. Officer, please tell us, if you will, how are the prince and my little son, York?They’re just fine, my dear madam. But I’m sorry—I’m not allowed to let you visit them. The king has strictly forbidden it.
