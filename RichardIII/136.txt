I hope he is, but yet let mothers doubt.Now, by my troth, if I had been remembered,I could have given my uncle’s grace a floutTo touch his growth nearer than he touched mine.How, my pretty York? I prithee let me hear it.Marry, they say my uncle grew so fastThat he could gnaw a crust at two hours old.'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?Grandam, his nurse.His nurse? Why, she was dead ere thou wast born.If ’twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.A parlous boy! Go to, you are too shrewd.Good madam, be not angry with the child.Pitchers have ears.Here comes a messenger. —What news?Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.#LBSFORGOLDI hope he is, but mothers get to have their doubts.Hey, if I’d remembered something about him, I could have had a good comeback for my uncle, touching on his growth worse than he touched on mine.What would you have said, my young York? Do tell.Indeed, they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw on a crust of bread when he was two hours old. It took me two years before I had a single tooth. Grandmother, this would have been a biting joke.Pretty York, who told you about his teeth?His nurse, grandmother.His nurse? Why, she was dead before you were even born.Well, if it wasn’t her, I don’t know.A mischievous child. Come, come, you are too clever for your own good.Good lady, don’t be angry with the child.Little pitchers have big ears.Here comes a messenger. What’s the news?My lord, it’s news I wish I didn’t have to report.
