Now, noble peers. the cause why we are metIs to determine of the coronation.In God’s name, speak. When is the royal day?Is all things ready for the royal time?It is, and wants but nomination.Tomorrow, then, I judge a happy day.Who knows the Lord Protector’s mind herein?Who is most inward with the noble duke?Your Grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.We know each other’s faces; for our hearts,He knows no more of mine than I of yours,Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.—Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.I thank his Grace. I know he loves me well.But for his purpose in the coronation,I have not sounded him, nor he deliveredHis gracious pleasure any way therein.But you, my honorable lords, may name the time,And in the duke’s behalf I’ll give my voice,Which I presume he’ll take in gentle part.#LBSFORGOLDNow, noble lords, the reason we’re meeting is to determine the day the prince will be crowned. In God’s name, speak. When should the royal day be?Is everything ready for that event?It is. All we have to do is name the day.Tomorrow’s a good day.Who knows what the Lord Protector thinks? Who’s closest to him?You, I think, would best know what he’s thinking.We know each other’s faces, but as for our thoughts, he doesn’t know any more about my thinking than I do about yours or his—or you do about mine. Lord Hastings, you and he are close.Thank you. I know he holds me dear, but I haven’t asked him about the coronation, and he hasn’t told me. But you, my noble lords, may name a time, and I’ll second it on the duke’s behalf, which I don’t think he’ll mind.
