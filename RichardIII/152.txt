O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.Then is he more beholding to you than I.He may command me as my sovereign,But you have power in me as in a kinsman.I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart.A beggar, brother?Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.A greater gift than that I’ll give my cousin.A greater gift? O, that’s the sword to it.Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.O, then I see you will part but with light gifts.In weightier things you’ll say a beggar nay.It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.What, would you have my weapon, little lord?I would, that I might thank you as you call me.How?#LBSFORGOLDOh, my handsome nephew, I must not say that.In that case, he’s more obliged to you than I am.He may command me as my king, but you still have power over me as a relative.Uncle, please give me your dagger.My dagger, little nephew? With all my heart.Are you begging, brother?From my kind uncle, who I know will give it to me, especially as it’s not worth much.I’ll give you a greater gift than that, nephew.A greater gift? That must mean a sword.Yes, gentle cousin, if it were light enough for you.Oh, I see, you will only part with lightweight presents. For more important things, you’ll say no.A sword’s too heavy for you to wear.I wouldn’t think much of it even if it were heavier.What, do you want to wear my weapon, little lord?I do, so I can thank you for what you called me.What’s that?
