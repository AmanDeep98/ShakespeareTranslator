Who knows not he is dead! Who knows he is?All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?Ay, my good lord, and no one in the presenceBut his red color hath forsook his cheeks.Is Clarence dead? The order was reversed.But he, poor man, by your first order died,And that a wingèd Mercury did bear.Some tardy cripple bear the countermand,That came too lag to see him burièd.God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,Nearer in bloody thoughts, and not in blood,Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,And yet go current from suspicion.
(kneeling) A boon, my sovereign, for my service done.I prithee, peace. My soul is full of sorrow.I will not rise unless your Highness hear me.Then say at once what is it thou requests.The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant’s life,Who slew today a riotous gentlemanLately attendant on the duke of Norfolk.#LBSFORGOLDWho doesn’t know he’s dead? Who says he is?Oh my God, what a terrible world this is!Do I look as pale as everyone else does, Lord Dorset?You do, my good lord. Everyone here has turned white.Is Clarence dead? But I reversed the death sentence.Well, the poor man died by your first order, which was carried by a winged messenger. Some tardy cripple must have taken the counter-order, who came after Clarence was already buried. It’s clear that someone less noble, less loyal, more bloody-minded than Clarence but not a blood relation, deserves as bad an end as my brother, but he goes free.
(kneeling) I ask a favor of you in return for the service I’ve done, my king.Please be quiet. My soul is full of sorrow.I will not rise until your Highness hears me.Then hurry up and tell me what you want.That you lift the death sentence on my servant, who killed a rowdy and belligerent former servant of the duke of Norfolk.
