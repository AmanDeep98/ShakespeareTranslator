In the meantime, think about how I can do you good and give you what you want. See you soon.     I humbly say goodbye.I’ve locked up Clarence’s son and matched his daughter with a poor fellow. Edward’s sons have been carried off by the angels and Anne, my wife, has bid good night to the world. Now I go, a jolly, thriving wooer, to marry my brother Edward’s young daughter, Elizabeth, because I know Richmond has his eye on her. He wants to win the crown by way of marrying her.
