I do remember me, Henry the SixthDid prophesy that Richmond should be king,When Richmond was a little peevish boy.A king, perhaps—My lord—How chance the prophet could not at that timeHave told me, I being by, that I should kill him?My lord, your promise for the earldom—Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,The mayor in courtesy showed me the castleAnd called it Rougemont, at which name I started,Because a bard of Ireland told me onceI should not live long after I saw Richmond.My Lord—Ay, what’s o'clock?I am thus bold to put your Grace in mindOf what you promised me.Well, but what’s o'clock?Upon the stroke of ten.Well, let it strike.Why let it strike?#LBSFORGOLDAs I remember, Henry the Sixth prophesied that Richmond would be king when Richmond was only a foolish little boy. A king, perhaps—My lord—How is it that the prophet didn’t tell me at the time that I would kill him?My lord, your promise of the earldom—Richmond! The last time I was in Exeter, the mayor kindly showed me the castle there and called it “RougemontThe words “Rougemont” and “Richmond” were pronounced similarly, and both mean “red hill.”Rougemont.” The name startled me because an Irish poet once told me that I would die soon after seeing “Richmond.”My lord!Yes, what time is it?I’m reminding your grace what you promised me.Well, but what time is it?It’s almost ten o'clock.Well, let it strike ten then.Why “let it strike”?
