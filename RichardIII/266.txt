Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curseAbides in me. I say amen to her.Stay, madam. I must talk a word with you.I have no more sons of the royal bloodFor thee to slaughter. For my daughters, Richard,They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens,And therefore level not to hit their lives.You have a daughter called Elizabeth,Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.And must she die for this? O, let her live,And I’ll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty,Slander myself as false to Edward’s bed,Throw over her the veil of infamy.So she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter,I will confess she was not Edward’s daughter.Wrong not her birth. She is a royal princess.To save her life, I’ll say she is not so.Her life is safest only in her birth.And only in that safety died her brothers.Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.No, to their lives ill friends were contrary.All unavoided is the doom of destiny.#LBSFORGOLDThough I have far more reason, I don’t have as much energy to curse you. But I say amen to everything she said.Wait, madam. I need to speak a word with you.I have no more royal sons for you to murder. As for my daughters, Richard, they will become praying nuns, not weeping queens. So don’t aim at them.You have a daughter named Elizabeth, who is virtuous and beautiful, aristocratic and full of grace.And does she have to die for this? Oh, let her live, and I’ll ruin her manners and her beauty. So that she may live, I’ll say I cheated on Edward and that she is not really his child.Don’t wrong her birth. She has royal blood.To save her life, I’ll say she doesn’t.Her life is only safe if she’s really of royal blood.Yes, as safe as her brothers' lives were.They were born under unlucky stars.The stars weren’t the problem. Bad friends were.You can’t escape a bad destiny.
