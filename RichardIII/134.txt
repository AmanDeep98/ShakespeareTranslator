Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford,And at Northampton they do rest tonight.Tomorrow or next day they will be here.I long with all my heart to see the prince.I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.But I hear no; they say my son of YorkHas almost overta'en him in his growth.Ay, mother, but I would not have it so.Why, my young cousin? It is good to grow.Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,My uncle Rivers talked how I did growMore than my brother: “Ay,” quoth my uncle Gloucester,“Small herbs have grace; great weeds do grow apace.”And since, methinks I would not grow so fastBecause sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.Good faith, good faith, the saying did not holdIn him that did object the same to thee!He was the wretched’st thing when he was young,So long a-growing and so leisurely,That if this rule were true, he should be gracious.And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.#LBSFORGOLDLast night, I hear, they stayed in Stony Stratford. Tonight they will rest in Northhampton. They’ll be here tomorrow or the next day.I’m dying to see the prince. I hope he’s grown a lot since I last saw him.But I hear he hasn’t. They say my son York has almost passed him in height.Yes, mother, but I wish I hadn’t.Why, dear child? It’s good to grow.Grandmother, one night when we were eating dinner, my uncle Rivers mentioned that I had grown more than my brother. “Yes,” said my uncle Gloucester, “Small plants are graceful, while ugly weeds grow fast.” And since then, I’ve wished I wouldn’t grow so fast, because sweet flowers are slow while the weeds grow in a hurry.Well, it certainly wasn’t true for Richard! As a child, he took such a long time to grow up that, according to his rule, he should have grown up into a gracious adult.And no doubt he is, gracious madam.
