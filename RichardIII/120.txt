Ah, for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!What stay had I but Edward? And he’s gone.What stay had we but Clarence? And he’s gone.What stays had I but they? And they are gone.Was never widow had so dear a loss.Were never orphans had so dear a loss.Was never mother had so dear a loss.Alas, I am the mother of these griefs.Their woes are parceled; mine are general.She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;I for a Clarence weep; so doth not she.These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;I for an Edward weep; so do not they.Alas, you three, on me, threefold distressed,Pour all your tears. I am your sorrow’s nurse,And I will pamper it with lamentations.#LBSFORGOLDOur poor father, Clarence!My sons Edward and Clarence!What support did I have other than Edward? And now he’s gone.What support did we have besides our father? And now he’s gone.What support did I have besides my two sons? And now they’re both gone.There has never been a widow who suffered such loss as me.There have never been orphans who’ve suffered what we have.There was never a mother who suffered so much loss. Alas, I am the mother of all these others' griefs. Each of them has a single loss, while I share them all. She weeps for Edward and so do I, while she does not weep for Clarence, though I do. These young children cry for Clarence and so do I, though they don’t cry for Edward, as I do. Alas, all of you can turn to me with your sorrow, because I feel all of it. I will comfort you by adding my own grief to your sorrow.
