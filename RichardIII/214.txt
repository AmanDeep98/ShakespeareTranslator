Do, good my lord. Your citizens entreat you.Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffered love.O, make them joyful. Grant their lawful suit.Alas, why would you heap this care on me?I am unfit for state and majesty.I do beseech you, take it not amiss;I cannot, nor I will not, yield to you.If you refuse it, as in love and zealLoath to depose the child, your brother’s son—As well we know your tenderness of heartAnd gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,Which we have noted in you to your kindredAnd equally indeed to all estates—Yet know whe'er you accept our suit or no,Your brother’s son shall never reign our king,But we will plant some other in the throne,To the disgrace and downfall of your house.And in this resolution here we leave you.—Come, citizens. Zounds, I’ll entreat no more.#LBSFORGOLDYes, my good lord, your citizens beg you.Don’t refuse the love we offer you.Oh, make them joyful! Grant their law-abiding request!Alas, why would you heap all these responsibilities on me? I am unfit to rule and to be king. Please, don’t take it badly, but I cannot and will not give in to you.Perhaps you refuse our request out of love for your brother’s son. You don’t want to depose the child. We know how tender your heart is and what gentle, kind, womanly feelings you have for your relatives, as well as for people from all walks of life.But listen, if you won’t become king, we’ll just get someone else, to the disgrace and ruin of your family. We will not have your brother’s son as king. On this note, we’re leaving. Come, citizens. Damn it, I’m not going to beg anymore!
