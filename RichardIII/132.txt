Whither away?Marry, we were sent for to the justices.And so was I. I’ll bear you company.#LBSFORGOLDIt’s always like this in times of change. By some sort of deep instinct, we always know when danger is approaching, just as we know that a storm is coming when the sea swells. But leave it all to God. Where are you all off to?The court has sent for us.For me, too. I’ll go with you.
