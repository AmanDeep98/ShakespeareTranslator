God bless your Grace with health and happy days.I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.—I thought my mother and my brother YorkWould long ere this have met us on the way.Fie, what a slug is Hastings that he comes notTo tell us whether they will come or no!And in good time here comes the sweating lord.Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?On what occasion God He knows, not I,The queen your mother and your brother YorkHave taken sanctuary. The tender princeWould fain have come with me to meet your Grace,But by his mother was perforce withheld.Fie, what an indirect and peevish courseIs this of hers! —Lord Cardinal, will your GracePersuade the queen to send the duke of YorkUnto his princely brother presently?—If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratoryCan from his mother win the duke of York,Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurateTo mild entreaties, God in heaven forbidWe should infringe the holy privilegeOf blessèd sanctuary! Not for all this landWould I be guilty of so deep a sin.#LBSFORGOLDGod bless your Grace with health and happy days.Thank you, my good lord, thank you all. I thought my mother and my brother, York, would have met us on our way here long before now. And what a slug Hastings is that he hasn’t even arrived to tell us whether they’re coming!And, just in time, here comes the sweaty lord.Welcome, my lord. What, isn’t my mother coming?God knows why, but your mother and your brother have taken sanctuary in Westminster Abbey. Your sweet brother wanted to come meet you, but his mother wouldn’t let him.Damn, what a sneaky and spiteful course your mother is taking!—Lord Cardinal, will you please persuade the queen to hurry and send the duke of York here?—Go with him, Lord Hastings, and if she refuses, take the boy from her by force.My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak skills of persuasion convince his mother to part with the duke of York, you can expect him here shortly. But if she resists my mild pleas, let God in heaven forbid us from disobeying the holy laws of the sanctuary and taking the child from her. I wouldn’t commit so serious a crime for anything.
