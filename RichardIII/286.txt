Most mighty sovereign, on the western coastRideth a puissant navy. To our shoresThrong many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,Unarmed and unresolved to beat them back.'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;And there they hull, expecting but the aidOf Buckingham to welcome them ashore.Some light-foot friend post to the duke of Norfolk—Ratcliffe, thyself, or Catesby. Where is he?Here, my good lord.Catesby, fly to the duke.I will, my lord, with all convenient haste.Ratcliffe, come hither. Post to Salisbury.When thou com’st thither— (to CATESBY) Dull, unmindful villain,Why stay’st thou here and go’st not to the duke?First, mighty liege, tell me your Highness' pleasure,What from your Grace I shall deliver to him.O true, good Catesby. Bid him levy straightThe greatest strength and power that he can makeAnd meet me suddenly at Salisbury.I go.#LBSFORGOLDMy noble king, a powerful fleet of ships sails on the western coast. Many former friends of ours have gathered to meet the fleet and aren’t willing to beat it back. Word is that Richmond is the navy’s admiral. The ships are drifting off the coast, sails unfurled, only waiting for Buckingham to help them come ashore.Someone who can ride fast, go to the duke of NorfolkNorfolk was a York loyalist–he stood behind Edward IV and Richard III, and he died fighting for Richard.Norfolk. You go, Ratcliffe, or Catesby. Where is Catesby?Here, my good lord.Catesby, fly to the duke.I will my lord, as fast as I can.Ratcliffe, come here. Ride to Salisbury. When you get there—(to CATESBY) Stupid, distracted rascal, why are you still standing there? Why haven’t you left for the duke’s?First, mighty king, tell me what you want me to tell him.Oh, right, good Catesby. Tell him to gather together the greatest army he can muster in a hurry and meet me right away at Salisbury.I’m off.
