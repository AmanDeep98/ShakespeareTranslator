Faith, none but Humfrey Hower, that called your GraceTo breakfast once, forth of my company.If I be so disgracious in your eye,Let me march on and not offend you, madam.—Strike up the drum.     I prithee, hear me speak.You speak too bitterly.     Hear me a word,For I shall never speak to thee again.So.Either thou wilt die by God’s just ordinanceEre from this war thou turn a conqueror,Or I with grief and extreme age shall perishAnd nevermore behold thy face again.Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse,Which in the day of battle tire thee moreThan all the complete armor that thou wear’st.My prayers on the adverse party fight,And there the little souls of Edward’s childrenWhisper the spirits of thine enemiesAnd promise them success and victory.Bloody thou art; bloody will be thy end.Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.#LBSFORGOLDI guess none except HumphreyHumphrey Hour is an obscure reference, though Shakespeare is probably playing off the expression, “to dine with Duke Humphrey,” which meant, “to go hungry.” Richard is saying, in effect, “The only comfort you ever had was an hour you had without me, at breakfast time when you were hungry.”Humphrey Hour, who once invited you to have breakfast without me. If I be such a disgrace in your eyes, let me march on and not offend you. Strike up the band!Please, listen to me.You’re too bitter.Just listen this once. I’ll never speak to you again.So be it.Either you will die as you should, before you’ve had a chance to win this battle, or I will die from grief and age and never look upon your face again. So, take with you my heaviest curse, which I hope wears you out in battle even more than your heavy suit of armor will. I pray that the little souls of Edward’s children will whisper to your enemies and promise them success and victory. You are violent, and your end will be violent. Your life was shameful, and let your death be, too.
