You are too senseless obstinate, my lord,Too ceremonious and traditional.Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,You break not sanctuary in seizing him.The benefit thereof is always grantedTo those whose dealings have deserved the placeAnd those who have the wit to claim the place.This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved itAnd therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.Then taking him from thence that is not there,You break no privilege nor charter there.Oft have I heard of sanctuary men,But sanctuary children, ne'er till now.My lord, you shall o'errule my mind for once.—Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?I go, my lord.Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?Where it seems best unto your royal self.If I may counsel you, some day or twoYour Highness shall repose you at the Tower;Then where you please and shall be thought most fitFor your best health and recreation.I do not like the Tower, of any place.—Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?#LBSFORGOLDYou are too inexplicably stubborn, my lord, too stuck on ceremony. In these less dainty times, you’re not breaking the laws of sanctuary to seize him. It’s only a sanctuary for those who really need protection or those who are smart enough to claim they do. The prince has done neither; therefore, in my opinion, he isn’t really protected by sanctuary. You’re not breaking any holy laws to take him away. Often I have heard of “sanctuary men,” but until now I’ve never heard of “sanctuary children.”My lord, you’ve won me over this time. Lord Hastings, will you go with me?I’m coming, my lord.Go as fast as you can.Say, uncle Richard, if my brother comes, where will I stay till my coronation?Whatever seems best to you. If I can give you some advice, if I were you, I would stay in the Tower for a day or two. Then you can stay wherever best suits your health and entertainment needs.Of all places, I don’t like the TowerJulius Caesar conquered Britain,which then became a part of the Roman Empire.Tower. Didn’t Julius Caesar build it, my lord?
