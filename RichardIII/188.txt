Come, cousin, canst thou quake and change thy color,Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,And then begin again, and stop again,As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian,Speak, and look back, and pry on every side,Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,Intending deep suspicion. Ghastly looksAre at my service, like enforcèd smiles,And both are ready in their offices,At any time to grace my stratagems.But what, is Catesby gone?He is; and see, he brings the mayor along.Lord Mayor—Look to the drawbridge there!Hark, a drum!Catesby, o'erlook the walls.#LBSFORGOLDTell me, cousin, I need to know if you can shake like you’ve got a fever, turn pale all of a sudden, and stop speaking in the middle of a word—as if you were driven crazy with fear.Oh please, I can imitate the best tragic actor around. I can speak and then look all around, and tremble, and start at a mere piece of straw as if I were paranoid. Frightening looks are also at my service, as are fake smiles. Anytime I need them, they’re waiting to do my bidding. But has Catesby gone?He has. But here he is, back with the mayor.Lord Mayor—Watch out for the drawbridgeRichard and Buckingham are pretending they are under attack.drawbridge over there!Listen! A drum!Catesby, look over the top of these walls to see if anyone’s there.
