True, when avoided grace makes destiny.My babes were destined to a fairer deathIf grace had blessed thee with a fairer life.You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.Cousins, indeed, and by their uncle cozenedOf comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.Whose hand soever launched their tender hearts,Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction.No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and bluntTill it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,To revel in the entrails of my lambs.But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,My tongue should to thy ears not name my boysTill that my nails were anchored in thine eyes,And I, in such a desp'rate bay of death,Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft,Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.Madam, so thrive I in my enterpriseAnd dangerous success of bloody warsAs I intend more good to you and yoursThan ever you or yours were by me harmed!What good is covered with the face of heaven,To be discovered, that can do me good?The advancement of your children, gentle lady.Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads.Unto the dignity and height of fortune,The high imperial type of this earth’s glory.#LBSFORGOLDTrue, when a king who defies God is choosing that destiny. My children would have enjoyed a better death if God had blessed you with a purer life.You speak as if I had killed my nephews.Nephews, indeed, cheated by their uncle of comfort, kingdom, relatives, freedom, and life. Whichever hand literally stabbed their tender hearts, you’re the one who gave the order. No doubt the murderous knife was blunt till it was sharpened on your stony heart—you reveled in my lambs' bloody guts. But constant expression of wild grief will only make it tame, so I’m not going to say any more about my boys until I’ve gouged your eyes out with my bare hands. Like a sailboat that has lost its sails, I will throw myself on your rocky bosom—and get torn to pieces.Madam, if I do as well as I think I’m going to do in these dangerous, violent wars, you and your relatives will have more good at my hands than you’ve ever had bad!What good does heaven have in store that can do me any good now?The advancement of your children, noble lady.Advancement to some scaffold, to lose their heads.No, advancement to the dignity and height of honor, to a high, imperial kind of glory.
