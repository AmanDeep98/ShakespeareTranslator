Thou wast the cause and most accursed effect.Your beauty was the cause of that effect—Your beauty, that did haunt me in my sleepTo undertake the death of all the world,So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.These eyes could never endure that beauty’s wrack.You should not blemish it, if I stood by.As all the world is cheerèd by the sun,So I by that. It is my day, my life.Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life.Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.I would I were, to be revenged on thee.It is a quarrel most unnaturalTo be revenged on him that loveth thee.It is a quarrel just and reasonableTo be revenged on him that killed my husband.He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husbandDid it to help thee to a better husband.His better doth not breathe upon the earth.#LBSFORGOLDYou’re both those people—responsible for both cause and effect.Your beauty caused what I did. It haunted me in my sleep. I would have killed the whole world just to be able spend one hour next to you.If I believed you, murderer, I would take my nails and scratch that beauty right off my cheeks.I couldn’t stand to see you destroy your beauty; you won’t touch it as long as I’m standing next to you. Just as everyone becomes cheerful from the sun, I’m cheered up by your looks. They are my daylight, my life.Then I hope night shadows your day, and death takes your life!Don’t damn yourself. You, fair lady, are both my day and my life.I wish I were, so I could deprive you of both day and life.It’s strange that you want to take revenge on the person who loves you.It’s just and reasonable that I want to take revenge on the person who killed my husband.The man who killed your husband, dear lady, only did it to help you get a better husband.There is no better one on earth.
