I fear no uncles dead.Nor none that live, I hope.An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
(to YORK) But come, my lord. With a heavy heart,Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.Think you, my lord, this little prating YorkWas not incensèd by his subtle motherTo taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?No doubt, no doubt. O, ’tis a parlous boy,Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable.He is all the mother’s, from the top to toe.Well, let them rest.—Come hither, Catesby.Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intendAs closely to conceal what we impart.Thou knowest our reasons, urged upon the way.What thinkest thou? Is it not an easy matterTo make William Lord Hastings of our mindFor the installment of this noble dukeIn the seat royal of this famous isle?He, for his father’s sake, so loves the princeThat he will not be won to aught against him.What think’st thou then of Stanley? Will not he?He will do all in all as Hastings doth.#LBSFORGOLDI’m not afraid of dead uncles.Nor living ones, I hope.Well, I hope not. (to YORK) But come, my lord. With a heavy heart, thinking about my dead uncles, I will go to the Tower.Richard, don’t you think this chattering little York was encouraged to taunt you by his sneaky mother in that outrageous way?No doubt, no doubt. Oh, he’s a dangerously clever boy—bold, quick-witted, capable. He’s his mother’s child from head to toe.Well, enough about them.—Come here, Catesby. You’ve sworn to participate in our plot and to keep it a secret. What do you think: wouldn’t it be easy to convince Lord Hastings to join us in installing Richard as king of England?Hastings loved the prince’s father so much that we won’t be able to persuade him to do anything against the prince.What about Stanley? Won’t he join us?He’ll do whatever Hastings does.
