(to QUEEN ELIZABETH) Madam, you’re not exempt from this—nor are you, Dorset— nor you, Buckingham. You have had too many separate factions among you. My dear wife, let Lord Hastings kiss your hand. And don’t do it merely for appearance’s sake.Take my hand, Hastings. From now on, I’ll forget the hatred I used to feel for you.Dorset, embrace Hastings.—Hastings, express your affection for the marquess of Dorset.I swear I will never break this promise of love.And so do I, my lord.Now, noble Buckingham, seal this alliance by embracing my wife’s friends, and make me happy in your unity.
