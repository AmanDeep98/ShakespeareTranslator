Right, as snow in harvest. Come, you deceive yourself.'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.It cannot be, for he bewept my fortune,And hugged me in his arms, and swore with sobsThat he would labor my delivery.Why, so he doth, when he delivers youFrom this earth’s thralldom to the joys of heaven.Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.Have you that holy feeling in your soulsTo counsel me to make my peace with God,And art you yet to your own souls so blindThat thou will war with God by murd'ring me?O sirs, consider: they that set you onTo do this deed will hate you for the deed.
(to FIRST MURDERER) What shall we do?     Relent, and save your souls.Which of you—if you were a prince’s sonBeing pent from liberty, as I am now—If two such murderers as yourselves came to you,Would not entreat for life? Ay, you would beg,Were you in my distress.Relent? No. 'Tis cowardly and womanish.#LBSFORGOLDYes, as kind as snow to a harvest. Come on, you’re fooling yourself. It’s Richard who sent us here to slaughter you.It cannot be. When I left him, he hugged me in his arms and swore between sobs that he would work to set me free.Well, that’s what he’s doing—making you free to enjoy heaven.Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.You have enough holy feeling to advise me to “make peace with God,” but you’re willing to go to war with God by murdering me? Oh sirs, consider this: those who sent you to do this deed will hate you for doing it.
(to FIRST MURDERER) What should we do?Relent, and save your souls. If either of you were a prince’s son, and you were imprisoned as I am now, and two murderers like yourselves came to you—wouldn’t you beg for your life? Yes, you would beg, if you were in my position.Relent? No. That’s cowardly and womanish.
