How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!Your eyes do menace me. Why look you pale?Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?To, to, to—To murder me?Ay, ay.You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?Offended us you have not, but the king.I shall be reconciled to him again.Never, my lord. Therefore prepare to die.Are you drawn forth among a world of menTo slay the innocent? What is my offense?Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?What lawful quest have given their verdict upUnto the frowning judge? Or who pronouncedThe bitter sentence of poor Clarence' deathBefore I be convict by course of law?To threaten me with death is most unlawful.I charge you, as you hope to have redemption,By Christ’s dear blood shed for our grievous sins,That you depart, and lay no hands on me.The deed you undertake is damnable.What we will do, we do upon command.#LBSFORGOLDThe things you say scare me! Your eyes look threatening. And why are you so pale? Who sent you here? Why are you here?To, to, to—To murder me?Yes.You barely have the heart to tell me, so you can’t possibly have the nerve to do it. Besides, how have I offended you, my friends?You didn’t offend us, you offended the king.He and I will make up.Never, my lord. So prepare to die.It’s your job in life to kill the innocent? What did I do wrong? Where’s the evidence against me? Where’s the jury, the judge, the lawful proceedings, the verdict? Who pronounced this death sentence before a court of law could even convict me? For you to threaten to kill me is most unlawful. If you hope to have your sins forgiven by Christ’s dear blood, which He shed for our terrible sins, you must leave and keep your hands off me. You’ll go to Hell for the deed you’re planning to do.What we do we have been commanded to do.
