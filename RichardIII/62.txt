Thou elvish-marked, abortive, rooting hog,Thou that wast sealed in thy nativityThe slave of nature and the son of hell,Thou slander of thy heavy mother’s womb,Thou loathèd issue of thy father’s loins,Thou rag of honor, thou detested—     Margaret.Richard!   Ha?I call thee not.I cry thee mercy, then, for I did thinkThat thou hadst called me all these bitter names.Why, so I did, but looked for no reply.O, let me make the period to my curse!'Tis done by me, and ends in “Margaret.”
(to QUEEN MARGARET)
Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune,Why strew’st thou sugar on that bottled spider,Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?Fool, fool, thou whet’st a knife to kill thyself.The day will come that thou shalt wish for meTo help thee curse that poisonous bunch-backed toad.False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.#LBSFORGOLDYou deformed, prematurely born, rooting hog, you evil birth defect, you insult to your mother’s womb, you hated disgrace to your father’s sperm, you disgusting—Margaret.Richard.Yes?I didn’t call you.I beg your pardon—I thought it was me whom you were calling all those terrible names.Yes, I was, but I don’t want an answer from you. Let me finish my curse.I’ve finished it for you, and it ends in “Margaret.”He’s turned your curse against you, Margaret.Poor imitation queen, why do you align yourself with this humpbacked spider when he’s got you trapped in his deadly web? Fool! You’re sharpening a knife to cut yourself. The day will come when you’ll wish I could help you cast spells against this poisonous, hunchbacked toad.Woman, stop your frantic curses and false prophesies before we run out of patience and do something bad to you.
