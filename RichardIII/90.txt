And he that hath commanded is our king.Erroneous vassals, the great King of kingsHath in the tables of His law commandedThat thou shalt do no murder. Will thou thenSpurn at His edict and fulfill a man’s?Take heed, for He holds vengeance in His handTo hurl upon their heads that break His law.And that same vengeance doth He hurl on theeFor false forswearing and for murder too.Thou didst receive the sacrament to fightIn quarrel of the house of Lancaster.And, like a traitor to the name of God,Didst break that vow, and with thy treacherous bladeUnrippedst the bowels of thy sovereign’s son.Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.How canst thou urge God’s dreadful law to usWhen thou hast broke it in such dear degree?Alas! For whose sake did I that ill deed?For Edward, for my brother, for his sake.He sends you not to murder me for this,For in that sin he is as deep as I.If God will be avengèd for this deed,O, know you yet He doth it publicly!Take not the quarrel from His powerful arm;He needs no indirect or lawless courseTo cut off those that have offended Him.#LBSFORGOLDAnd the one who commands us is our king.Wrong-headed slaves, the King of kings says in his Ten Commandments, “Thou shalt not murder.” Will you defy God and obey a man? Be careful. God takes revenge on those who break His laws.He does, and now he’s taking revenge on you—for breaking promises and for murder, too. You took a holy oath to fight for King Henry VI.And like a traitor to God, you broke that oath and savagely murdered King Henry’s young son.Whom you swore you would protect and defend.How dare you tell us about God’s laws when you have broken them so savagely yourself?But for whose sake did I do that sick deed? For my brother Edward’s sake. He couldn’t be sending you to murder me for that sin, because he’s the one who asked me to commit it. He is as guilty as I am. If God will be revenged for this deed, he will do it publicly. God doesn’t need to use indirect or illegal means to kill those who have offended him.
