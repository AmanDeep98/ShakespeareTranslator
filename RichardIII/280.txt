I swear—     By nothing, for this is no oath.Thy George, profaned, hath lost his lordly honor;Thy garter, blemished, pawned his knightly virtue;Thy crown, usurped, disgraced his kingly glory.If something thou wouldst swear to be believed,Swear then by something that thou hast not wronged.Then, by myself—     Thyself is self-misused.Now, by the world—     'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.My father’s death—     Thy life hath it dishonored.Why then, by God.     God’s wrong is most of all.If thou didst fear to break an oath by Him,The unity the king my husband madeThou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died.If thou hadst feared to break an oath by Him,Th' imperial metal circling now thy headHad graced the tender temples of my child,And both the princes had been breathing here,Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust,Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms.What canst thou swear by now?#LBSFORGOLDI swear—By nothing, because this is no oath. St. George loses his holiness once you have sworn by him; you’ve ruined the emblem of the knighthood, and the crown lost its kingly glory once you stole it. If you want me to believe something you’ll swear to, then swear by something you haven’t wronged.Then, by myself—You’ve misused yourself.Now, by the world—It’s full of your ugly wrongdoings.By my father’s death—Your life has dishonored his death.Why then, by God—You wrong God most of all. If you had been afraid to break an oath with him, you wouldn’t have ruined the united front the king, my husband, created before he died, and you wouldn’t have killed my brothers. If you had been afraid to break an oath with him, the crown you are currently wearing would have graced the head of my child, and both princes would still be alive, not preyed on by worms. What can you swear by now?
