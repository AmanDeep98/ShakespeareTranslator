What, think you we are Turks or infidels?Or that we would, against the form of law,Proceed thus rashly in the villain’s death,But that the extreme peril of the case,The peace of England and our persons' safetyEnforced us to this execution?Now fair befall you! He deserved his death,And your good Graces both have well proceededTo warn false traitors from the like attempts.I never looked for better at his handsAfter he once fell in with Mistress Shore.Yet had we not determined he should dieUntil your Lordship came to see his end(Which now the loving haste of these our friends,Something against our meaning, have prevented),Because, my lord, I would have had you heardThe traitor speak, and timorously confessThe manner and the purpose of his treasons,That you might well have signified the sameUnto the citizens, who haply mayMisconstrue us in him, and wail his death.But, my good lord, your Graces' words shall serveAs well as I had seen and heard him speak;And do not doubt, right noble princes both,But I’ll acquaint our duteous citizensWith all your just proceedings in this case.And to that end we wished your Lordship hereT' avoid the censures of the carping world.#LBSFORGOLDWhat, do you think we’re Turks or savages, instead of Christians? You think we would have disobeyed the law and proceeded to kill this villain if England’s peace and our own lives hadn’t been at stake?I hope nothing else like this ever happens to you! This man deserved his death. And you, my good lords, were right to warn other traitors from trying the same.I didn’t expect any better from him once he got involved with Mistress Shore. But we had decided that he shouldn’t die until you were able to come witness his execution. (Which was prevented by the haste of our friends, Lovell and Ratcliffe here, who went against what we intended somewhat in their hurry to protect us). If you could have heard the traitor speak for himself and confess the exact way he planned to murder us, you could have told the citizens what terrible intentions he had, though now they’re likely to misconstrue what we did and wail over his death.But, my good lord, the words of you and Lord Buckingham are as trustworthy to me as if I had seen and heard him speak myself. And do not doubt, you honest, noble princes, that I’ll let our citizens know how fairly you proceeded in this case.That is exactly why we wanted you here, your lordship—to avoid the public carping and complaints.
