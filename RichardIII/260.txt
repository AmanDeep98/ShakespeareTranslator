Who intercepts my expedition?O, she that might have intercepted thee,By strangling thee in her accursèd womb,From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done.Hid’st thou that forehead with a golden crownWhere should be branded, if that right were right,The slaughter of the prince that owed that crownAnd the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?Tell me, thou villain-slave, where are my children?Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?And little Ned Plantagenet his son?Where is gentle Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?Where is kind Hastings?A flourish, trumpets! Strike alarum, drums!Let not the heavens hear these telltale womenRail on the Lord’s anointed. Strike, I say!Either be patient and entreat me fair,Or with the clamorous report of warThus will I drown your exclamations.Art thou my son?#LBSFORGOLDWho’s blocking the way?The woman who might have blocked you from all the murders you’ve committed by strangling you in her cursed womb.Are you hiding your forehead with a golden crown, when, if there was any justice in this world, it should be branded with the murders you committed—your slaughter of the prince who held that crown, and of my sons and my brothers? Tell me, you villainous lowlife, where are my children?You toad, where is your brother Clarence and his son, little Ned Plantagenet?Where are the noble Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?Where is kind Hastings?Play, trumpets! A call to arms, drums! Don’t let the heavens hear these chattery women abuse the Lord’s anointed king. Play, I say!Either be calm and polite or I’ll drown you out with the music of war.Are you my son?
