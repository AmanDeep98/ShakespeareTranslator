What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?No. He’ll say ’twas done cowardly, when he wakes.Why, he shall never wake until the great Judgment Day.Why, then he’ll say we stabbed him sleeping.The urging of that word “judgment” hath bred a kind of
remorse in me.
What, art thou afraid?Not to kill him, having a warrant, but to be damned for
killing him, from the which no warrant can defend me.
I thought thou hadst been resolute.So I am—to let him live.I’ll back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so.Nay, I prithee stay a little. I hope this passionate humor of
mine will change. It was wont to hold me but while one tells
twenty.
How dost thou feel thyself now?Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me.#LBSFORGOLDWhat, should I stab him while he sleeps?No. When he wakes up, he’ll say we killed him like cowards.When he wakes up! Why, he won’t wake up till Judgment Day.Okay, so that’s when he’ll say we stabbed him in his sleep.That word “judgment” makes me feel a bit guilty.What, are you afraid?Not of killing him, because I have a warrant for it, but of being damned for killing him, which no warrant can protect me from.I thought you were resolved to do this.I am resolved—to let him live.I’ll go back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so.Please, just wait a minute. I’m hoping my holy mood will pass. It usually only lasts about twenty seconds.How are you feeling now?Actually, I’m still feeling some pangs of conscience.
