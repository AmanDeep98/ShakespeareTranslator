Look your heart be firm.Or else his head’s assurance is but frail.So deal with him as I prove true to you.My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,As I by friends am well advertisèd,Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate,Bishop of Exeter, his elder brother,With many more confederates are in arms.In Kent, my liege, the Guilfords are in arms,And every hour more competitorsFlock to the rebels, and their power grows strong.My lord, the army of great Buckingham—Out on you, owls! Nothing but songs of death.
