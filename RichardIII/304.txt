Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,Have we marched on without impediment,Thus far into the bowels of the landAnd here receive we from our father StanleyLines of fair comfort and encouragement.The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,That spoiled your summer fields and fruitful vines,Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his troughIn your embowelled bosoms—this foul swineIs now even in the center of this isle,Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn.From Tamworth thither is but one day’s march.In God’s name, cheerly on, courageous friends,To reap the harvest of perpetual peaceBy this one bloody trial of sharp war.Every man’s conscience is a thousand men,To fight against this guilty homicide.I doubt not but his friends will turn to us.He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.Which in his dearest need will fly from him.All for our vantage. Then, in God’s name, march.True hope is swift, and flies with swallow’s wings.Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.#LBSFORGOLDFellow soldiers and my loyal friends suffering under that tyrant Richard, we have marched all the way to the center of England without encountering any opposition. And now we receive encouraging news from my stepfather Stanley: Richard—that violent, greedy boar who roots through your summer fields and ripening vines, guzzles your warm blood, and makes his trough in your disemboweled bellies—is now near the town of Leicester, only one day’s march from us here in TamworthTamworth is in central England.Tamworth. In God’s name, let’s continue on in high spirits, my courageous friends. Our aim is to achieve everlasting peace from this one violent war.Every man’s conscience is a thousand swords against this murderer.I suspect his friends will join us.He has no friends except those who are too afraid to defy him. In his greatest need, even they will desert him.All to our advantage. So, in God’s name, let’s march. Hope with good cause is swift; it flies as fast as a swallow. It turns kings into gods and men of lower rank into kings.
