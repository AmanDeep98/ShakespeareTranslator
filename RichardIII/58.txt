So just is God to right the innocent.O, ’twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.No man but prophesied revenge for it.Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.What, were you snarling all before I came,Ready to catch each other by the throat,And turn you all your hatred now on me?Did York’s dread curse prevail so much with heavenThat Henry’s death, my Lovelly Edward’s death,Their kingdom’s loss, my woeful banishment,Could all but answer for that peevish brat?Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?Why then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!Though not by war, by surfeit die your king,As ours by murder to make him a king.#LBSFORGOLDGod is just. He rewards the innocent.Oh, killing that child was the dirtiest, most merciless deed there ever was!Tyrants themselves wept when they heard about it.Everyone understood there would be a heavy payback.Even NorthumberlandThe earl of Northumberland was an enemy of Richard’s family, the House of York.Northumberland wept to see it.What, were you all snarling before I arrived, ready to catch each other by the throat like dogs, but now that I’m here, you turn your hatred toward me? Did the duke of York’s terrible curse have so much weight with God that God repaid him not only with Henry’s death and my lovely Edward’s death but with the loss of their kingdom and with my banishment, too? All because of what happened to that brat Rutland? If curses can pierce the clouds and enter heaven that easily, then open up, thick clouds, and listen to my curses!
