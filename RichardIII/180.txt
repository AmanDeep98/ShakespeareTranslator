In happy time here comes the duke himself.My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.I have been long a sleeper; but I trustMy absence doth neglect no great designWhich by my presence might have been concluded.Had you not come upon your cue, my lord,William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part—I mean your voice for crowning of the king.Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder.His Lordship knows me well, and loves me well.—My lord of Ely, when I was last in HolbornI saw good strawberries in your garden there;I do beseech you, send for some of them.Marry and will, my lord, with all my heart.Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
They move aside
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our businessAnd finds the testy gentleman so hotAs he will lose his head ere give consentHis master’s child, as worshipfully he terms it,Shall lose the royalty of England’s throne.Withdraw yourself awhile. I’ll go with you.#LBSFORGOLDRight on cue, here’s the duke himself.My noble lords and relatives, good morning. I slept in. But I hope I didn’t delay any important decisions.If you hadn’t shown up on cue, my lord, Lord Hastings was going to take your part—I mean, he was going to speak for you—in the crowning of the king.No one may be bolder than my Lord Hastings. He knows me well and loves me well.—Ely, when I was last at your palace, I saw some great strawberries in your garden. I beg you, send someone to bring some of them.Yes, my lord. With pleasure.Buckingham, I need to have a word with you. (drawing him aside) Catesby has sounded Hastings out and found the prickly gentleman so opposed to our plan that he actually said he would die before he’d agree to have his “master’s son,” as he put it so devotedly, lose the crown.Move to the other room, my lord. I’ll come soon.
