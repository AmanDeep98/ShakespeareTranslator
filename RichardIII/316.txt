O Thou, whose captain I account myself,Look on my forces with a gracious eye.Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,That they may crush down with a heavy fallThe usurping helmets of our adversaries!Make us thy ministers of chastisement,That we may praise thee in the victory!To thee I do commend my watchful soul,Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes.Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!
Sleeps

(to RICHARD) Let me sit heavy on thy soul tomorrow!Think how thou stabbed’st me in my prime of youthAt Tewkesbury. Despair therefore, and die!
(to RICHMOND)
Be cheerful, Richmond, for the wrongèd soulsOf butchered princes fight in thy behalf.King Henry’s issue, Richmond, comforts thee.
(to RICHARD) When I was mortal, my anointed bodyBy thee was punchèd full of deadly holes.Think on the Tower and me. Despair, and die!Harry the Sixth bids thee despair and die.
(to RICHMOND)
Virtuous and holy, be thou conqueror.Harry, that prophesied thou shouldst be king,Doth comfort thee in thy sleep. Live and flourish.#LBSFORGOLDOh God, whose side I think I’m fighting on, look kindly on my forces. Fuel them with dangerous fury, so they can crush the enemy. Make us your agents of revenge, so we can praise you when we’re victorious! Before I fall asleep, I entrust my soul to you. Defend me, God, both when I’m asleep and when I’m awake.
He sleeps.
(to RICHARD) I will weigh heavily on your soul tomorrow. Remember how you stabbed me at Tewksbury, when I was just a young man. Despair, and die! (to RICHMOND) Be cheerful, Richmond—butchered princes fight for you. I, King Henry’s son, will provide you with comfort.
(to RICHARD) When I was still alive, you punctured my body, the body of God’s blessed king, full of holes. Remember the Tower and me there. Despair, and die! Harry the Sixth commands you to despair and die! (to RICHMOND) Because you are virtuous and holy, you must be the conqueror! Harry, who prophesied that you would be king, comforts you in your sleep: live and prosper!
