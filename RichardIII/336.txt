What says Lord Stanley? Will he bring his power?My lord, he doth deny to come.Off with his son George’s head!My lord, the enemy is past the marsh.After the battle let George Stanley die.A thousand hearts are great within my bosom.Advance our standards. Set upon our foes.Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons.Upon them! Victory sits on our helms.#LBSFORGOLDWhat does Lord Stanley say? Will he bring his army?My lord, he refuses to come.Off with his son George’s head!My lord, the enemy has already passed the marsh. Let George Stanley die after the battle.A thousand hearts beat in my chest. Let’s advance our flags, set upon our enemies, and have our ancient saint of courage, good Saint George, inspire us with the fury of fiery dragons! Let’s go! Victory is with us.
