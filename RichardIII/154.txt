Little.My lord of York will still be cross in talk.Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.—Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me.Because that I am little, like an ape,He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
(aside) With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,He prettily and aptly taunts himself.So cunning and so young is wonderful.
(to PRINCE) My lord, will ’t please you pass along?Myself and my good cousin BuckinghamWill to your mother, to entreat of herTo meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
