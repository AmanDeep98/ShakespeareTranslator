Who made thee then a bloody ministerWhen gallant-springing, brave Plantagenet,That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?My brother’s love, the devil, and my rage.Thy brother’s love, our duty, and thy faultsProvoke us hither now to slaughter thee.If you do love my brother, hate not me.I am his brother, and I love him well.If you are hired for meed, go back again,And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,Who shall reward you better for my lifeThan Edward will for tidings of my death.You are deceived. Your brother Gloucester hates you.O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.Go you to him from me.     Ay, so we will.Tell him, when that our princely father YorkBlessed his three sons with his victorious arm,He little thought of this divided friendship.Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.Ay, millstones, as he lessoned us to weep.O, do not slander him, for he is kind.#LBSFORGOLDThen who were you working for when you killed brave, young Prince Edward?My brother’s love, the devil, and my own anger made me do it.Well, your brother’s love, our duty, and your own crimes make us kill you.If you love my brother, don’t hate me. I am his brother, and I love him very much. If you’re doing this for pay, go to my brother Richard. He will pay you more for saving my life than Edward will for killing me.You’re mistaken. Richard, the duke of Gloucester, hates you.No, he loves and cherishes me. Go to him from me.We will.Tell him that when our noble father, the duke of York, gave his three sons his blessing, he never imagined that our friendship would come to this. Remind Richard of this, and he will weep.Yes, he’ll weep stones, as he taught us to do.Don’t lie about my brother. He is kind.
