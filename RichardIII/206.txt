Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!He is not lolling on a lewd love bed,But on his knees at meditation;Not dallying with a brace of courtesans,But meditating with two deep divines;Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.Happy were England would this virtuous princeTake on his grave the sovereignty thereof.But sure I fear we shall not win him to it.Marry, God defend his grace should say us nay!I fear he will. Here Catesby comes again.Now, Catesby, what says his grace?He wonders to what end you have assembledSuch troops of citizens to come to him,His grace not being warned thereof before.He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.Sorry I am my noble cousin shouldSuspect me that I mean no good to him.By heaven, we come to him in perfect love,And so once more return and tell his grace.When holy and devout religious menAre at their beads, ’tis much to draw them thence,So sweet is zealous contemplation.#LBSFORGOLDAh, my lord, this prince is nothing like Edward! He is not lolling in bed but on his knees in prayer. He’s not enjoying himself with a couple of prostitutes but studying with two learned priests. He’s not sleeping to fatten up his lazy body, but praying, to nourish his attentive soul. England would be lucky to have this virtuous prince as king. But I’m afraid we’ll never get him to agree to be king.But God forbid he says no to us!I’m afraid he will. Here comes Catesby again.What’s up, Catesby, what does your master say?My lord, he wonders why you have assembled such troops of citizens to speak with him, since he had no idea they were coming. My lord, he’s afraid you mean him harm.I’m sorry my noble brother is suspicious of me. By God, I’m here because I love him. Return and tell him so.When devoutly religious men are praying, it’s hard to draw them out of it, because they get lost in the wonder of their contemplation.
