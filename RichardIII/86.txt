Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword, and

O excellent device— and make a sop of him.Soft, he wakes.Strike!No, we’ll reason with him.Where art thou, keeper? Give me a cup of wine.You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.In God’s name, what art thou?     A man, as you are.But not, as I am, royal.Nor you, as we are, loyal.Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.My voice is now the king’s, my looks mine own.#LBSFORGOLDSpoken like a brave man who respects his reputation. Shall we get to work?We’ll hit him on the head with the handles of our swords, then throw him in the wine barrel in the next room.What an excellent idea—he’ll soak up the wine!Wait a moment. He’s waking up.Strike!No, first let’s talk to him.Where are you, keeper? Give me a cup of wine.You’ll have wine enough, my lord, soon.In God’s name, who are you?A man, like you.But not a member of the royal family, like me.And you’re not loyal, like us.Your voice is loud and commanding, but you look like a working man.I’m speaking for the king, but I look like myself.
