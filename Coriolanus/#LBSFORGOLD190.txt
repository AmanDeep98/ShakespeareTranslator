Well, I must do’t:Away, my disposition, and possess meSome harlot’s spirit! my throat of war be turn’d,Which quired with my drum, into a pipeSmall as an eunuch, or the virgin voiceThat babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knavesTent in my cheeks, and schoolboys’ tears take upThe glasses of my sight! a beggar’s tongueMake motion through my lips, and my arm’d knees,Who bow’d but in my stirrup, bend like hisThat hath received an alms! I will not do’t,Lest I surcease to honour mine own truthAnd by my body’s action teach my mindA most inherent baseness.At thy choice, then:To beg of thee, it is my more dishonourThan thou of them. Come all to ruin; letThy mother rather feel thy pride than fearThy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at deathWith as big heart as thou. Do as thou listThy valiantness was mine, thou suck’dst it from me,But owe thy pride thyself.Pray, be content:Mother, I am going to the market-place;Chide me no more. I’ll mountebank their loves,Cog their hearts from them, and come home belovedOf all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:Commend me to my wife. I’ll return consul;Or never trust to what my tongue can doI’ the way of flattery further.#LBSFORGOLD
