Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit wouldfly?Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man’swill; ’tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, butif it were at liberty, ’twould, sure, southward.Why that way?To lose itself in a fog, where being three partsmelted away with rotten dews, the fourth would returnfor conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.Are you all resolved to give your voices? Butthat’s no matter, the greater part carries it. Isay, if he would incline to the people, there wasnever a worthier man.Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark hisbehavior. We are not to stay all together, but tocome by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, andby threes. He’s to make his requests byparticulars; wherein every one of us has a singlehonour, in giving him our own voices with our owntongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you howyou shall go by him.ALL Content, content.#LBSFORGOLD
