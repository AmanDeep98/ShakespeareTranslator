How now, my as fair as noble ladies,—and the moon,were she earthly, no nobler,—whither do you followyour eyes so fast?Honourable Menenius, my boy Martius approaches; forthe love of Juno, let’s go.Ha! Martius coming home!Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous approbation.Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!Martius coming home!Nay, ’tis true.Look, here’s a letter from him: the state hathanother, his wife another; and, I think, there’s oneat home for you.I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter forme!Yes, certain, there’s a letter for you; I saw’t.A letter for me! it gives me an estate of sevenyears’ health; in which time I will make a lip atthe physician: the most sovereign prescription inGalen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,of no better report than a horse-drench. Is henot wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.#LBSFORGOLD
