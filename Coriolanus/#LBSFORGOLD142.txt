LayA fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,No impediment between, but that you mustCast your election on him.Say, you chose himMore after our commandment than as guidedBy your own true affections, and that your minds,Preoccupied with what you rather must doThan what you should, made you against the grainTo voice him consul: lay the fault on us.Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.How youngly he began to serve his country,How long continued, and what stock he springs of,The noble house o’ the Marcians, from whence cameThat Ancus Martius, Numa’s daughter’s son,Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,That our beat water brought by conduits hither;And [Censorinus,] nobly named so,Twice being [by the people chosen] censor,Was his great ancestor.One thus descended,That hath beside well in his person wroughtTo be set high in place, we did commendTo your remembrances: but you have found,Scaling his present bearing with his past,That he’s your fixed enemy, and revokeYour sudden approbation.#LBSFORGOLD
