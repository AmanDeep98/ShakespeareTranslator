If, by the tribunes’ leave, and yours, good people,I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;The which shall turn you to no further harmThan so much loss of time.Speak briefly then;For we are peremptory to dispatchThis viperous traitor: to eject him henceWere but one danger, and to keep him hereOur certain death: therefore it is decreedHe dies to-night.Now the good gods forbidThat our renowned Rome, whose gratitudeTowards her deserved children is enroll’dIn Jove’s own book, like an unnatural damShould now eat up her own!He’s a disease that must be cut away.O, he’s a limb that has but a disease;Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.What has he done to Rome that’s worthy death?Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost—Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,By many an ounce—he dropp’d it for his country;And what is left, to lose it by his country,Were to us all, that do’t and suffer it,A brand to the end o’ the world.#LBSFORGOLD
