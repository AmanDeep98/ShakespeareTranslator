You worthy tribunes,—He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rockWith rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,And therefore law shall scorn him further trialThan the severity of the public powerWhich he so sets at nought.He shall well knowThe noble tribunes are the people’s mouths,And we their hands.He shall, sure on’t.Sir, sir,—Peace!Do not cry havoc, where you should but huntWith modest warrant.Sir, how comes’t that youHave holp to make this rescue?Hear me speak:As I do know the consul’s worthiness,So can I name his faults,—Consul! what consul?The consul Coriolanus.He consul!No, no, no, no, no.#LBSFORGOLD
