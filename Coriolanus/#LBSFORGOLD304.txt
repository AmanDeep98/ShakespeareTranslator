Ay, and mine,That brought you forth this boy, to keep your nameLiving to time.A’ shall not tread on me;I’ll run away till I am bigger, but then I’ll fight.Not of a woman’s tenderness to be,Requires nor child nor woman’s face to see.I have sat too long.Nay, go not from us thus.If it were so that our request did tendTo save the Romans, thereby to destroyThe Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,As poisonous of your honour: no; our suitIs that you reconcile them: while the VolscesMay say ‘This mercy we have show’d;’ the Romans,‘This we received;’ and each in either sideGive the all-hail to thee and cry ‘Be blestFor making up this peace!’ Thou know’st, great son,The end of war’s uncertain, but this certain,That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefitWhich thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,Whose repetition will be dogg’d with curses;Whose chronicle thus writ: ‘The man was noble,But with his last attempt he wiped it out;Destroy’d his country, and his name remainsTo the ensuing age abhorr’d.’ Speak to me, son:Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,To imitate the graces of the gods;To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o’ the air,And yet to charge thy sulphur with a boltThat should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?Think’st thou it honourable for a noble manStill to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:Perhaps thy childishness will move him moreThan can our reasons. There’s no man in the worldMore bound to ’s mother; yet here he lets me prateLike one i’ the stocks. Thou hast never in thy lifeShow’d thy dear mother any courtesy,When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,Has cluck’d thee to the wars and safely home,Loaden with honour. Say my request’s unjust,And spurn me back: but if it be not so,Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,That thou restrain’st from me the duty whichTo a mother’s part belongs. He turns away:Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.To his surname Coriolanus ’longs more prideThan pity to our prayers. Down: an end;This is the last: so we will home to Rome,And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold ’s:This boy, that cannot tell what he would haveBut kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,Does reason our petition with more strengthThan thou hast to deny ’t. Come, let us go:This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;His wife is in Corioli and his childLike him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:I am hush’d until our city be a-fire,And then I’ll speak a little.#LBSFORGOLD
