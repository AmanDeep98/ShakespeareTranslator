What is granted them?Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,Of their own choice: one’s Junius Brutus,Sicinius Velutus, and I know not—’Sdeath!The rabble should have first unroof’d the city,Ere so prevail’d with me: it will in timeWin upon power and throw forth greater themesFor insurrection’s arguing.This is strange.(to the rebels) Go, get you home, you fragments!Where’s Caius Martius?Here: what’s the matter?The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.I am glad on ‘t: then we shall ha’ means to ventOur musty superfluity.
