You bless me, gods!Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt haveThe leading of thine own revenges, takeThe one half of my commission; and set down—As best thou art experienced, since thou know’stThy country’s strength and weakness,—thine own ways;Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,Or rudely visit them in parts remote,To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:Let me commend thee first to those that shallSay yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!And more a friend than e’er an enemy;Yet, Martius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!Here’s a strange alteration!By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him witha cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made afalse report of him.What an arm he has! he turned me about with hisfinger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.Nay, I knew by his face that there was something inhim: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,—Icannot tell how to term it.#LBSFORGOLD
