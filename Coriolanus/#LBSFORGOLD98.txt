Know, good mother,I had rather be their servant in my way,Than sway with them in theirs.On, to the Capitol!All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sightsAre spectacled to see him: your prattling nurseInto a rapture lets her baby cryWhile she chats him: the kitchen malkin pinsHer richest lockram ’bout her reechy neck,Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,Are smother’d up, leads fill’d, and ridges horsedWith variable complexions, all agreeingIn earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamensDo press among the popular throngs and puffTo win a vulgar station: or veil’d damesCommit the war of white and damask inTheir nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoilOf Phoebus’ burning kisses: such a potherAs if that whatsoever god who leads himWere slily crept into his human powersAnd gave him graceful posture.On the sudden,I warrant him consul.#LBSFORGOLD
