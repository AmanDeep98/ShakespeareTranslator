Prithee now,Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst ratherFollow thine enemy in a fiery gulfThan flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.I have been i’ the market-place; and, sir, ’tis fitYou make strong party, or defend yourselfBy calmness or by absence: all’s in anger.Only fair speech.I think ’twill serve, if heCan thereto frame his spirit.He must, and willPrithee now, say you will, and go about it.Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?Must I with base tongue give my noble heartA lie that it must bear? Well, I will do’t:Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,This mould of Martius, they to dust should grind itAnd throw’t against the wind. To the market-place!You have put me now to such a part which neverI shall discharge to the life.Come, come, we’ll prompt you.I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast saidMy praises made thee first a soldier, so,To have my praise for this, perform a partThou hast not done before.#LBSFORGOLD
