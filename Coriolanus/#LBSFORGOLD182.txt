Let go.You might have been enough the man you are,With striving less to be so; lesser had beenThe thwartings of your dispositions, ifYou had not show’d them how ye were disposedEre they lack’d power to cross you.Let them hang.Ay, and burn too.Come, come, you have been too rough, somethingtoo rough;You must return and mend it.There’s no remedy;Unless, by not so doing, our good cityCleave in the midst, and perish.Pray, be counsell’d:I have a heart as little apt as yours,But yet a brain that leads my use of angerTo better vantage.Well said, noble woman!Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but thatThe violent fit o’ the time craves it as physicFor the whole state, I would put mine armour on,Which I can scarcely bear.#LBSFORGOLD
