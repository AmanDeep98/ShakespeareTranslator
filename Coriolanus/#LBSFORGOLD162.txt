We’ll surety him.Aged sir, hands off.Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bonesOut of thy garments.Help, ye citizens!On both sides more respect.Here’s he that would take from you all your power.Seize him, Aediles!Down with him! down with him!Weapons, weapons, weapons!Tribunes! Patricians! Citizens! What, ho!Sicinius! Brutus! Coriolanus! Citizens!‘Peace, peace, peace!’ ‘Stay, hold, peace!’What is about to be? I am out of breath;Confusion’s near; I cannot speak. You, tribunesTo the people! Coriolanus, patience!Speak, good Sicinius.Hear me, people; peace!Let’s hear our tribune: peace! Speak, speak, speak.You are at point to lose your liberties:Martius would have all from you; Martius,Whom late you have named for consul.#LBSFORGOLD
