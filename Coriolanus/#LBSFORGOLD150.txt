Be calm, be calm.It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,To curb the will of the nobility:Suffer’t, and live with such as cannot ruleNor ever will be ruled.Call’t not a plot:The people cry you mock’d them, and of late,When corn was given them gratis, you repined;Scandal’d the suppliants for the people, call’d themTime-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.Why, this was known before.Not to them all.Have you inform’d them sithence?How! I inform them!You are like to do such business.Not unlike,Each way, to better yours.Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,Let me deserve so ill as you, and make meYour fellow tribune.You show too much of thatFor which the people stir: if you will passTo where you are bound, you must inquire your way,Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,Or never be so noble as a consul,Nor yoke with him for tribune.#LBSFORGOLD
