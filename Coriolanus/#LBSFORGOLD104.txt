You are sent for to the Capitol. ’Tis thoughtThat Martius shall be consul:I have seen the dumb men throng to see him andThe blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,Upon him as he pass’d: the nobles bended,As to Jove’s statue, and the commons madeA shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:I never saw the like.Let’s to the Capitol;And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,But hearts for the event.Have with you.#LBSFORGOLD
