Coriolanus banished!Banished, sir.You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.The day serves well for them now. I have heard itsaid, the fittest time to corrupt a man’s wife iswhen she’s fallen out with her husband. Your nobleTullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, hisgreat opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no requestof his country.He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thusaccidentally to encounter you: you have ended mybusiness, and I will merrily accompany you home.I shall, between this and supper, tell you moststrange things from Rome; all tending to the good oftheir adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,and to be on foot at an hour’s warning.I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am theman, I think, that shall set them in present action.So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.You take my part from me, sir; I have the most causeto be glad of yours.#LBSFORGOLD
