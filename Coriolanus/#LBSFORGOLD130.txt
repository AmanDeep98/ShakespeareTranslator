Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of yourvoices that I may be consul, I have here thecustomary gown.You have deserved nobly of your country, and youhave not deserved nobly.Your enigma?You have been a scourge to her enemies, you havebeen a rod to her friends; you have not indeed lovedthe common people.You should account me the more virtuous that I havenot been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter mysworn brother, the people, to earn a dearerestimation of them; â€™tis a condition they accountgentle: and since the wisdom of their choice israther to have my hat than my heart, I will practisethe insinuating nod and be off to them mostcounterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit thebewitchment of some popular man and give itbountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,I may be consul.We hope to find you our friend; and therefore giveyou our voices heartily.You have received many wounds for your country.#LBSFORGOLD
