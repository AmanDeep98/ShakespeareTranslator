Bid them all home; he’s gone, and we’ll no further.The nobility are vex’d, whom we see have sidedIn his behalf.Now we have shown our power,Let us seem humbler after it is doneThan when it was a-doing.Bid them home:Say their great enemy is gone, and theyStand in their ancient strength.Dismiss them home.Here comes his mother.Let’s not meet her.Why?They say she’s mad.They have ta’en note of us: keep on your way.O, ye’re well met: the hoarded plague o’ the godsRequite your love!Peace, peace; be not so loud.If that I could for weeping, you should hear,—Nay, and you shall hear some.#LBSFORGOLD
