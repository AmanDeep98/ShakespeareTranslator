How! no more!As for my country I have shed my blood,Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungsCoin words till their decay against those measles,Which we disdain should tatter us, yet soughtThe very way to catch them.You speak o’ the people,As if you were a god to punish, notA man of their infirmity.’Twere wellWe let the people know’t.What, what? his choler?Choler!Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,By Jove, ’twould be my mind!It is a mindThat shall remain a poison where it is,Not poison any further.Shall remain!Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark youHis absolute ‘shall’?’Twas from the canon.‘Shall’!O good but most unwise patricians! why,You grave but reckless senators, have you thusGiven Hydra here to choose an officer,That with his peremptory ‘shall,’ being butThe horn and noise o’ the monster’s, wants not spiritTo say he’ll turn your current in a ditch,And make your channel his? If he have powerThen vail your ignorance; if none, awakeYour dangerous lenity. If you are learn’d,Be not as common fools; if you are not,Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,If they be senators: and they are no less,When, both your voices blended, the great’st tasteMost palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,And such a one as he, who puts his ‘shall,’His popular ‘shall’ against a graver benchThan ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!It makes the consuls base: and my soul achesTo know, when two authorities are up,Neither supreme, how soon confusionMay enter ’twixt the gap of both and takeThe one by the other.#LBSFORGOLD
