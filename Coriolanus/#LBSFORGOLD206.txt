The people’s enemy is gone, is gone!Our enemy is banish’d! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,As he hath followed you, with all despite;Give him deserved vexation. Let a guardAttend us through the city.Come, come; let’s see him out at gates; come.The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.#LBSFORGOLD
