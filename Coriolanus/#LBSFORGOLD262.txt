If!He is their god: he leads them like a thingMade by some other deity than nature,That shapes man better; and they follow him,Against us brats, with no less confidenceThan boys pursuing summer butterflies,Or butchers killing flies.You have made good work,You and your apron-men; you that stood so up muchon the voice of occupation andThe breath of garlic-eaters!He will shakeYour Rome about your ears.As HerculesDid shake down mellow fruit.You have made fair work!But is this true, sir?Ay; and you’ll look paleBefore you find it other. All the regionsDo smilingly revolt; and who resistAre mock’d for valiant ignorance,And perish constant fools. Who is’t can blame him?Your enemies and his find something in him.#LBSFORGOLD
