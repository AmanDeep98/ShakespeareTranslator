Fie, fie, fie!This is the way to kindle, not to quench.To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.What is the city but the people?True,The people are the city.By the consent of all, we were establish’dThe people’s magistrates.You so remain.And so are like to do.That is the way to lay the city flat;To bring the roof to the foundation,And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,In heaps and piles of ruin.This deserves death.Or let us stand to our authority,Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,Upon the part o’ the people, in whose powerWe were elected theirs, Martius is worthyOf present death.Therefore lay hold of him;Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thenceInto destruction cast him.#LBSFORGOLD
