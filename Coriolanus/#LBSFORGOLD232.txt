Wine, wine, wine! What serviceis here! I think our fellows are asleep.Where’s Cotus? my master callsfor him. Cotus!A goodly house: the feast smells well; but IAppear not like a guest.What would you have, friend? whence are you?Here’s no place for you: pray, go to the door.I have deserved no better entertainment,In being Coriolanus.Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in hishead; that he gives entrance to such companions?Pray, get you out.Away!#LBSFORGOLD
