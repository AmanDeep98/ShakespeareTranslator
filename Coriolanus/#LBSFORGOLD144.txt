Say, you ne’er had done’t—Harp on that still—but by our putting on;And presently, when you have drawn your number,Repair to the Capitol.ALL We will so: almost allRepent in their election.Let them go on;This mutiny were better put in hazard,Than stay, past doubt, for greater:If, as his nature is, he fall in rageWith their refusal, both observe and answerThe vantage of his anger.To the Capitol, come:We will be there before the stream o’ the people;And this shall seem, as partly ’tis, their own,Which we have goaded onward.#LBSFORGOLD
