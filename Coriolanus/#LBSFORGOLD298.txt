Like a dull actor now,I have forgot my part, and I am out,Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,Forgive my tyranny; but do not sayFor that ‘Forgive our Romans.’ O, a kissLong as my exile, sweet as my revenge!Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kissI carried from thee, dear; and my true lipHath virgin’d it e’er since. You gods! I prate,And the most noble mother of the worldLeave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i’ the earth;Of thy deep duty more impression showThan that of common sons.O, stand up blest!Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,I kneel before thee; and unproperlyShow duty, as mistaken all this whileBetween the child and parent.What is this?Your knees to me? to your corrected son?Then let the pebbles on the hungry beachFillip the stars; then let the mutinous windsStrike the proud cedars ’gainst the fiery sun;Murdering impossibility, to makeWhat cannot be, slight work.#LBSFORGOLD
