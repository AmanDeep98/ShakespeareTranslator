Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.Speak, speak.You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?Resolved. resolved.First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people.We know’t, we know’t.Let us kill him, and we’ll have corn at our own price.Is’t a verdict?No more talking on’t; let it be done: away, away!One word, good citizens.We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if theywould yield us but the superfluity, while it werewholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;but they think we are too dear: the leanness thatafflicts us, the object of our misery, is as aninventory to particularise their abundance; oursufferance is a gain to them. Let us revenge this withour pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know Ispeak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.Would you proceed especially against Caius Martius?#LBSFORGOLD
