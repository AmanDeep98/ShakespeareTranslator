Shall I be tempted to infringe my vowIn the same time ’tis made? I will not.My wife comes foremost; then the honour’d mouldWherein this trunk was framed, and in her handThe grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!All bond and privilege of nature, break!Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.What is that curt’sy worth? or those doves’ eyes,Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am notOf stronger earth than others. My mother bows;As if Olympus to a molehill shouldIn supplication nod: and my young boyHath an aspect of intercession, whichGreat nature cries ‘Deny not.’ let the VolscesPlough Rome and harrow Italy: I’ll neverBe such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,As if a man were author of himselfAnd knew no other kin.My lord and husband!These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.The sorrow that delivers us thus changedMakes you think so.#LBSFORGOLD
