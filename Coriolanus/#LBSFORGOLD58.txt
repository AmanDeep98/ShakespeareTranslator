Flower of warriors,How is it with Titus Lartius?As with a man busied about decrees:Condemning some to death, and some to exile;Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,To let him slip at will.Where is that slaveWhich told me they had beat you to your trenches?Where is he? call him hither.Let him alone;He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,The common file—a plague! tribunes for them!--The mouse ne’er shunn’d the cat as they did budgeFrom rascals worse than they.But how prevail’d you?Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.Where is the enemy? are you lords o’ the field?If not, why cease you till you are so?Martius,We have at disadvantage fought and didRetire to win our purpose.#LBSFORGOLD
