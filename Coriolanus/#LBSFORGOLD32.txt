I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in amore comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, Ishould freelier rejoice in that absence wherein hewon honour than in the embracements of his bed wherehe would show most love. When yet he was buttender-bodied and the only son of my womb, whenyouth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, whenfor a day of kingsâ€™ entreaties a mother should notsell him an hour from her beholding, I, consideringhow honour would become such a person. that it wasno better than picture-like to hang by the wall, ifrenown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seekdanger where he was like to find fame. To a cruelwar I sent him; from whence he returned, his browsbound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang notmore in joy at first hearing he was a man-childthan now in first seeing he had proved himself aman.But had he died in the business, madam; how then?Then his good report should have been my son; Itherein would have found issue. Hear me professsincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my lovealike and none less dear than thine and my goodMartius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for theircountry than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.#LBSFORGOLD
