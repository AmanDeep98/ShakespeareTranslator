If I should tell thee o’er this thy day’s work,Thou’ldst not believe thy deeds: but I’ll report itWhere senators shall mingle tears with smiles,Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,I’ the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,And, gladly quaked, hear more; where thedull tribunes,That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,Shall say against their hearts ‘We thank the godsOur Rome hath such a soldier.’Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,Having fully dined before.O general,Here is the steed, we the caparison:Hadst thou beheld—Pray now, no more: my mother,Who has a charter to extol her blood,When she does praise me grieves me. I have doneAs you have done; that’s what I can; inducedAs you have been; that’s for my country:He that has but effected his good willHath overta’en mine act.#LBSFORGOLD
