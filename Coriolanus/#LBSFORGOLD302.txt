O, no more, no more!You have said you will not grant us any thing;For we have nothing else to ask, but thatWhich you deny already: yet we will ask;That, if you fail in our request, the blameMay hang upon your hardne therefore hear us.Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we’llHear nought from Rome in private. Your request?Should we be silent and not speak, our raimentAnd state of bodies would bewray what lifeWe have led since thy exile. Think with thyselfHow more unfortunate than all living womenAre we come hither: since that thy sight,which shouldMake our eyes flow with joy, hearts dancewith comforts,Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;Making the mother, wife and child to seeThe son, the husband and the father tearingHis country’s bowels out. And to poor weThine enmity’s most capital: thou barr’st usOur prayers to the gods, which is a comfortThat all but we enjoy; for how can we,Alas, how can we for our country pray.Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must loseThe country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,Our comfort in the country. We must findAn evident calamity, though we hadOur wish, which side should win: for either thouMust, as a foreign recreant, be ledWith manacles thorough our streets, or elsetriumphantly tread on thy country’s ruin,And bear the palm for having bravely shedThy wife and children’s blood. For myself, son,I purpose not to wait on fortune tillThese wars determine: if I cannot persuade theeRather to show a noble grace to both partsThan seek the end of one, thou shalt no soonerMarch to assault thy country than to tread—Trust to’t, thou shalt not—on thy mother’s womb,That brought thee to this world.#LBSFORGOLD
