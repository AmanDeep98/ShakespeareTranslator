Nor did you think it follyTo keep your great pretences veil’d till whenThey needs must show themselves; whichin the hatching,It seem’d, appear’d to Rome. By the discovery.We shall be shorten’d in our aim, which wasTo take in many towns ere almost RomeShould know we were afoot.Noble Aufidius,Take your commission; hie you to your bands:Let us alone to guard Corioli:If they set down before ’s, for the removeBring your army; but, I think, you’ll findThey’ve not prepared for us.O, doubt not that;I speak from certainties. Nay, more,Some parcels of their power are forth already,And only hitherward. I leave your honours.If we and Caius Martius chance to meet,’Tis sworn between us we shall ever strikeTill one can do no more.The gods assist you!And keep your honours safe!#LBSFORGOLD
