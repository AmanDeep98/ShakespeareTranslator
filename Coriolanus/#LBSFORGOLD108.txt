He hath deserved worthily of his country: and hisascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,having been supple and courteous to the people,bonneted, without any further deed to have them atall into their estimation and report: but he hath soplanted his honours in their eyes, and his actionsin their hearts, that for their tongues to besilent, and not confess so much, were a kind ofingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were amalice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluckreproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, theyare coming.Having determined of the Volsces andTo send for Titus Lartius, it remains,As the main point of this our after-meeting,To gratify his noble service thatHath thus stood for his country: therefore,please you,Most reverend and grave elders, to desireThe present consul, and last generalIn our well-found successes, to reportA little of that worthy work performâ€™dBy Caius Martius Coriolanus, whomWe met here both to thank and to rememberWith honours like himself.
