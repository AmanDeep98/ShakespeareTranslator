I shall lack voice: the deeds of CoriolanusShould not be utter’d feebly. It is heldThat valour is the chiefest virtue, andMost dignifies the haver: if it be,The man I speak of cannot in the worldBe singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he foughtBeyond the mark of others: our then dictator,Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,When with his Amazonian chin he droveThe bristled lips before him: be bestridAn o’er-press’d Roman and i’ the consul’s viewSlew three opposers: Tarquin’s self he met,And struck him on his knee: in that day’s feats,When he might act the woman in the scene,He proved best man i’ the field, and for his meedWas brow-bound with the oak. His pupil ageMan-enter’d thus, he waxed like a sea,And in the brunt of seventeen battles sinceHe lurch’d all swords of the garland. For this last,Before and in Corioli, let me say,I cannot speak him home: he stopp’d the fliers;And by his rare example made the cowardTurn terror into sport: as weeds beforeA vessel under sail, so men obey’dAnd fell below his stem: his sword, death’s stamp,Where it did mark, it took; from face to footHe was a thing of blood, whose every motionWas timed with dying cries: alone he enter’dThe mortal gate of the city, which he paintedWith shunless destiny; aidless came off,And with a sudden reinforcement struckCorioli like a planet: now all’s his:When, by and by, the din of war gan pierceHis ready sense; then straight his doubled spiritRe-quicken’d what in flesh was fatigate,And to the battle came he; where he didRun reeking o’er the lives of men, as if ’Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call’dBoth field and city ours, he never stoodTo ease his breast with panting.#LBSFORGOLD
