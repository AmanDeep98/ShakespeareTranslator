Where is he, hear you?Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wifeHear nothing from him.The gods preserve you both!God-den, our neighbours.God-den to you all, god-den to you all.Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,Are bound to pray for you both.Live, and thrive!Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish’d CoriolanusHad loved you as we did.Now the gods keep you!Farewell, farewell.This is a happier and more comely timeThan when these fellows ran about the streets,Crying confusion.Caius Martius wasA worthy officer i’ the war; but insolent,O’ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,Self-loving,—And affecting one sole throne,Without assistance.#LBSFORGOLD
