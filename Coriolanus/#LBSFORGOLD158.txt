Come, enough.Enough, with over-measure.No, take more:What may be sworn by, both divine and human,Seal what I end withal! This double worship,Where one part does disdain with cause, the otherInsult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,Cannot conclude but by the yea and noOf general ignorance,—it must omitReal necessities, and give way the whileTo unstable slightne purpose so barr’d,it follows,Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,—You that will be less fearful than discreet,That love the fundamental part of stateMore than you doubt the change on’t, that preferA noble life before a long, and wishTo jump a body with a dangerous physicThat’s sure of death without it, at once pluck outThe multitudinous tongue; let them not lickThe sweet which is their poison: your dishonourMangles true judgment and bereaves the stateOf that integrity which should become’t,Not having the power to do the good it would,For the in which doth control’t.#LBSFORGOLD
