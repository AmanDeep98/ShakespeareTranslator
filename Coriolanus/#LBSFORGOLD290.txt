Away!How! away!Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairsAre servanted to others: though I oweMy revenge properly, my remission liesIn Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, ratherThan pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.Mine ears against your suits are stronger thanYour gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,Take this along; I writ it for thy sakeAnd would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold’st!You keep a constant temper.Now, sir, is your name Menenius?’Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know theway home again.Do you hear how we are shent for keeping yourgreatness back?What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?#LBSFORGOLD
