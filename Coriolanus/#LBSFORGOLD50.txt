This will I carry to Rome.And I this.A murrain on’t! I took this for silver.See here these movers that do prize their hoursAt a crack’d drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen wouldBury with those that wore them, these base slaves,Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!There is the man of my soul’s hate, Aufidius,Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, takeConvenient numbers to make good the city;Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will hasteTo help Cominius.Worthy sir, thou bleed’st;Thy exercise hath been too violent forA second course of fight.Sir, praise me not;My work hath yet not warm’d me: fare you well:The blood I drop is rather physicalThan dangerous to me: to Aufidius thusI will appear, and fight.#LBSFORGOLD
