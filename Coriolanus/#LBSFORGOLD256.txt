I think not so.We should by this, to all our lamentation,If he had gone forth consul, found it so.The gods have well prevented it, and RomeSits safe and still without him.Worthy tribunes,There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,Reports, the Volsces with two several powersAre enter’d in the Roman territories,And with the deepest malice of the warDestroy what lies before ’em.’Tis Aufidius,Who, hearing of our Martius’ banishment,Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;Which were inshell’d when Martius stood for Rome,And durst not once peep out.Come, what talk youOf Martius?Go see this rumourer whipp’d. It cannot beThe Volsces dare break with us.Cannot be!We have record that very well it can,And three examples of the like have beenWithin my age. But reason with the fellow,Before you punish him, where he heard this,Lest you shall chance to whip your informationAnd beat the messenger who bids bewareOf what is to be dreaded.#LBSFORGOLD
