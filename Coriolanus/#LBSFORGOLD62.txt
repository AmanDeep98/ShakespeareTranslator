O, me alone! make you a sword of me?If these shows be not outward, which of youBut is four Volsces? none of you but isAble to bear against the great AufidiusA shield as hard as his. A certain number,Though thanks to all, must I selectfrom all: the restShall bear the business in some other fight,As cause will be obeyâ€™d. Please you to march;And four shall quickly draw out my command,Which men are best inclined.March on, my fellows:Make good this ostentation, and you shallDivide in all with us.#LBSFORGOLD
