Directitude! what’s that?But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,and the man in blood, they will out of theirburrows, like conies after rain, and revel all withhim.But when goes this forward?To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have thedrum struck up this afternoon: ’tis, as it were, aparcel of their feast, and to be executed ere theywipe their lips.Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increasetailors, and breed ballad-makers.Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far asday does night; it’s spritely, waking, audible, andfull of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of morebastard children than war’s a destroyer of men.’Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said tobe a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is agreat maker of cuckolds.Ay, and it makes men hate one another.Reason; because they then less need one another.The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheapas Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.ALL In, in, in, in!#LBSFORGOLD#LBSFORGOLD
