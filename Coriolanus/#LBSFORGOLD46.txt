So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:’Tis for the followers fortune widens them,Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.Fool-hardiness; not I.Nor I.See, they have shut him in.To the pot, I warrant him.What is become of Martius?Slain, sir, doubtless.Following the fliers at the very heels,With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,Clapp’d to their gates: he is himself alone,To answer all the city.O noble fellow!Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Martius:A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldierEven to Cato’s wish, not fierce and terribleOnly in strokes; but, with thy grim looks andThe thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the worldWere feverous and did tremble.#LBSFORGOLD
