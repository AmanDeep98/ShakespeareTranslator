We stay here for the people.Fare you well.He has it now, and by his looks methink’Tis warm at ’s heart.With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.will you dismiss the people?How now, my masters! have you chose this man?He has our voices, sir.We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,He mock’d us when he begg’d our voices.CertainlyHe flouted us downright.No, ’tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.Not one amongst us, save yourself, but saysHe used us scornfully: he should have show’d usHis marks of merit, wounds received for’s country.Why, so he did, I am sure.No, no; no man saw ’em.He said he had wounds, which he could showin private;And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,‘I would be consul,’ says he: ‘aged custom,But by your voices, will not so permit me;Your voices therefore.’ When we granted that,Here was ‘I thank you for your voices: thank you:Your most sweet voices: now you have leftyour voices,I have no further with you.’ Was not this mockery?#LBSFORGOLD
