Indeed, madam?In earnest, it’s true; I heard a senator speak it.Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; againstwhom Cominius the general is gone, with one part ofour Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are setdown before their city Corioli; they nothing doubtprevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in everything hereafter.(to Valeria) Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will butdisease our better mirth.In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thysolemness out o’ door and go along with us.No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wishyou much mirth.Well, then, farewell.#LBSFORGOLD
