He had so; looking as it were—would I were hanged,but I thought there was more in him than I could think.So did I, I’ll be sworn: he is simply the rarestman i’ the world.I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.Who, my master?Nay, it’s no matter for that.Worth six on him.Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be thegreater soldier.Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.Ay, and for an assault too.O slaves, I can tell you news,—news, you rascals!What, what, what? let’s partake.I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had aslieve be a condemned man.Wherefore? wherefore?Why, here’s he that was wont to thwack our general,Caius Martius.Why do you say ‘thwack our general’?I do not say ‘thwack our general;’ but he was alwaysgood enough for him.#LBSFORGOLD
