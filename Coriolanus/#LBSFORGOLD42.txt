Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.My horse to yours, no.’Tis done.Agreed.Say, has our general met the enemy?They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.So, the good horse is mine.I’ll buy him of you.No, I’ll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I willFor half a hundred years. Summon the town.How far off lie these armies?Within this mile and half.Then shall we hear their ’larum, and they ours.Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,That we with smoking swords may march from hence,To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.(to the Senators) Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?No, nor a man that fears you less than he,That’s lesser than a little.#LBSFORGOLD
