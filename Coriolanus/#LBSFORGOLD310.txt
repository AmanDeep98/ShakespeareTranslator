See you yond coign o’ the Capitol, yondcorner-stone?Why, what of that?If it be possible for you to displace it with yourlittle finger, there is some hope the ladies ofRome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.But I say there is no hope in’t: our throats aresentenced and stay upon execution.Is’t possible that so short a time can alter thecondition of a man!There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;yet your butterfly was a grub. This Martius is grownfrom man to dragon: he has wings; he’s more than acreeping thing.He loved his mother dearly.So did he me: and he no more remembers his mothernow than an eight-year-old horse. The tartnessof his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, hemoves like an engine, and the ground shrinks beforehis treading: he is able to pierce a corslet withhis eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is abattery. He sits in his state, as a thing made forAlexander. What he bids be done is finished withhis bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternityand a heaven to throne in.#LBSFORGOLD
