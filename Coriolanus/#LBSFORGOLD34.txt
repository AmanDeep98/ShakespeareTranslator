(to Volumnia) Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.Indeed, you shall not.Methinks I hear hither your husband’s drum,See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:‘Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,Though you were born in Rome:’ his bloody browWith his mail’d hand then wiping, forth he goes,Like to a harvest-man that’s task’d to mowOr all or lose his hire.His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!Away, you fool! it more becomes a manThan gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,When she did suckle Hector, look’d not lovelierThan Hector’s forehead when it spit forth bloodAt Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,We are fit to bid her welcome.Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!He’ll beat Aufidius’ head below his kneeAnd tread upon his neck.#LBSFORGOLD
