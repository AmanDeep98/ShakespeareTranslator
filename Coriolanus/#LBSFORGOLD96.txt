A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weepAnd I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.A curse begin at very root on’s heart,That is not glad to see thee! You are threeThat Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,We have some old crab-trees hereat home that will notBe grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:We call a nettle but a nettle andThe faults of fools but folly.Ever right.Menenius ever, ever.Give way there, and go on![To VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA] Your hand, and yours:Ere in our own house I do shade my head,The good patricians must be visited;From whom I have received not only greetings,But with them change of honours.I have livedTo see inherited my very wishesAnd the buildings of my fancy: onlyThere’s one thing wanting, which I doubt not butOur Rome will cast upon thee.#LBSFORGOLD
