Noble lady!Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,Not what is dangerous present, but the lossOf what is past.I prithee now, my son,Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;And thus far having stretch’d it—here be with them—Thy knee bussing the stones—for in such businessAction is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorantMore learned than the ears—waving thy head,Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,Now humble as the ripest mulberryThat will not hold the handling: or say to them,Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broilsHast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frameThyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so farAs thou hast power and person.This but done,Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;For they have pardons, being ask’d, as freeAs words to little purpose.#LBSFORGOLD
