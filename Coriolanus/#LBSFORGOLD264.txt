We are all undone, unlessThe noble man have mercy.Who shall ask it?The tribunes cannot do’t for shame; the peopleDeserve such pity of him as the wolfDoes of the shepherds: for his best friends, if theyShould say ‘Be good to Rome,’ they charged him evenAs those should do that had deserved his hate,And therein show’d like enemies.’Tis true:If he were putting to my house the brandThat should consume it, I have not the faceTo say ‘Beseech you, cease.’ You have made fair hands,You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!You have broughtA trembling upon Rome, such as was neverSo incapable of help.Say not we brought it.How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beastsAnd cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,Who did hoot him out o’ the city.But I fearThey’ll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,The second name of men, obeys his pointsAs if he were his officer: desperationIs all the policy, strength and defence,That Rome can make against them.#LBSFORGOLD
