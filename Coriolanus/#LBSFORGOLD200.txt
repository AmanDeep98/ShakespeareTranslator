Thou injurious tribune!Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,In thy hand clutch’d as many millions, inThy lying tongue both numbers, I would say‘Thou liest’ unto thee with a voice as freeAs I do pray the gods.Mark you this, people?To the rock, to the rock with him!Peace!We need not put new matter to his charge:What you have seen him do and heard him speak,Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,Opposing laws with strokes and here defyingThose whose great power must try him; even this,So criminal and in such capital kind,
