No, I’ll not go: you hear what he hath saidWhich was sometime his general; who loved himIn a most dear particular. He call’d me father:But what o’ that? Go, you that banish’d him;A mile before his tent fall down, and kneeThe way into his mercy: nay, if he coy’dTo hear Cominius speak, I’ll keep at home.He would not seem to know me.Do you hear?Yet one time he did call me by my name:I urged our old acquaintance, and the dropsThat we have bled together. CoriolanusHe would not answer to: forbad all names;He was a kind of nothing, titleless,Till he had forged himself a name o’ the fireOf burning Rome.Why, so: you have made good work!A pair of tribunes that have rack’d for Rome,To make coals cheap,—a noble memory!I minded him how royal ’twas to pardonWhen it was less expected: he replied,It was a bare petition of a stateTo one whom they had punish’d.#LBSFORGOLD
