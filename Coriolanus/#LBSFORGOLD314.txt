As certain as I know the sun is fire:Where have you lurk’d, that you make doubt of it?Ne’er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,Make the sun dance. Hark you!This is good news:I will go meet the ladies. This VolumniaIs worth of consuls, senators, patricians,A city full; of tribunes, such as you,A sea and land full. You have pray’d well to-day:This morning for ten thousand of your throatsI’d not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,Accept my thankfulness.Sir, we have allGreat cause to give great thanks.They are near the city?Almost at point to enter.#LBSFORGOLD
