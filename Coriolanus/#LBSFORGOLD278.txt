Very well:Could he say less?I offer’d to awaken his regardFor’s private friends: his answer to me was,He could not stay to pick them in a pileOf noisome musty chaff: he said ’twas folly,For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,And still to nose the offence.For one poor grain or two!I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:You are the musty chaff; and you are smeltAbove the moon: we must be burnt for you.Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aidIn this so never-needed help, yet do notUpbraid’s with our distress. But, sure, if youWould be your country’s pleader, your good tongue,More than the instant army we can make,Might stop our countryman.No, I’ll not meddle.Pray you, go to him.What should I do?Only make trial what your love can doFor Rome, towards Martius.#LBSFORGOLD
