Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!All will be naught else.Get you gone.Stand fast;We have as many friends as enemies.Sham it be put to that?The gods forbid!I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;Leave us to cure this cause.For ’tis a sore upon us,You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.Come, sir, along with us.I would they were barbarians—as they are,Though in Rome litter’d—not Romans—as they are not,Though calved i’ the porch o’ the Capitol—Be gone;Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;One time will owe another.On fair groundI could beat forty of them.I could myselfTake up a brace o’ the best of them; yea, thetwo tribunes:But now ’tis odds beyond arithmetic;And manhood is call’d foolery, when it standsAgainst a falling fabric. Will you hence,Before the tag return? whose rage doth rendLike interrupted waters and o’erbearWhat they are used to bear.#LBSFORGOLD
