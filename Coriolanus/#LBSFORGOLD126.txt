O sir, you are not right: have you not knownThe worthiest men have done’t?What must I say?‘I Pray, sir’—Plague upon’t! I cannot bringMy tongue to such a pace:—‘Look, sir, my wounds!I got them in my country’s service, whenSome certain of your brethren roar’d and ranFrom the noise of our own drums.’O me, the gods!You must not speak of that: you must desire themTo think upon you.Think upon me! hang ’em!I would they would forget me, like the virtuesWhich our divines lose by ’em.You’ll mar all:I’ll leave you: pray you, speak to ’em, I pray you,In wholesome manner.Bid them wash their facesAnd keep their teeth clean.So, here comes a brace.#LBSFORGOLD
