You shall not beThe grave of your deserving; Rome must knowThe value of her own: ’twere a concealmentWorse than a theft, no less than a traducement,To hide your doings; and to silence that,Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch’d,Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech youIn sign of what you are, not to rewardWhat you have done—before our army hear me.I have some wounds upon me, and they smartTo hear themselves remember’d.Should they not,Well might they fester ’gainst ingratitude,And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,Whereof we have ta’en good and good store, of allThe treasure in this field achieved and city,We render you the tenth, to be ta’en forth,Before the common distribution, atYour only choice.I thank you, general;But cannot make my heart consent to takeA bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;And stand upon my common part with thoseThat have beheld the doing.#LBSFORGOLD
