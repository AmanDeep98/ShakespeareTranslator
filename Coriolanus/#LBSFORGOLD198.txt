Amen, amen.A noble wish.Draw near, ye people.List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!First, hear me speak.Well, say. Peace, ho!Shall I be charged no further than this present?Must all determine here?I do demand,If you submit you to the people’s voices,Allow their officers and are contentTo suffer lawful censure for such faultsAs shall be proved upon you?I am content.Lo, citizens, he says he is content:The warlike service he has done, consider; thinkUpon the wounds his body bears, which showLike graves i’ the holy churchyard.Scratches with briers,Scars to move laughter only.Consider further,That when he speaks not like a citizen,You find him like a soldier: do not takeHis rougher accents for malicious sounds,But, as I say, such as become a soldier,Rather than envy you.#LBSFORGOLD
