Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in hisbehalf as you have uttered words in your own, youshould not pass here; no, though it were as virtuousto lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,always factionary on the party of your general.Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say youhave, I am one that, telling true under him, mustsay, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would notspeak with him till after dinner.You are a Roman, are you?I am, as thy general is.Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,when you have pushed out your gates the verydefender of them, and, in a violent popularignorance, given your enemy your shield, think tofront his revenges with the easy groans of oldwomen, the virginal palms of your daughters, or withthe palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant asyou seem to be? Can you think to blow out theintended fire your city is ready to flame in, withsuch weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for yourexecution: you are condemned, our general has swornyou out of reprieve and pardon.#LBSFORGOLD
