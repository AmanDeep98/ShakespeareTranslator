Well, and say that MartiusReturn me, as Cominius is return’d,Unheard; what then?But as a discontented friend, grief-shotWith his unkindness? say’t be so?Yet your good willmust have that thanks from Rome, after the measureAs you intended well.I’ll undertake ’t:I think he’ll hear me. Yet, to bite his lipAnd hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.He was not taken well; he had not dined:The veins unfill’d, our blood is cold, and thenWe pout upon the morning, are unaptTo give or to forgive; but when we have stuff’dThese and these conveyances of our bloodWith wine and feeding, we have suppler soulsThan in our priest-like fasts: therefore I’ll watch himTill he be dieted to my request,And then I’ll set upon him.You know the very road into his kindness,And cannot lose your way.Good faith, I’ll prove him,Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledgeOf my success.#LBSFORGOLD
