What work’s, my countrymen, in hand? where go youWith bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.Our business is not unknown to the senate; they havehad inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,which now we’ll show ’em in deeds. They say poorsuitors have strong breaths: they shall know wehave strong arms too.Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,Will you undo yourselves?We cannot, sir, we are undone already.I tell you, friends, most charitable careHave the patricians of you. For your wants,Your suffering in this dearth, you may as wellStrike at the heaven with your staves as lift themAgainst the Roman state, whose course will onThe way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbsOf more strong link asunder than can everAppear in your impediment. For the dearth,The gods, not the patricians, make it, andYour knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,You are transported by calamityThither where more attends you, and you slanderThe helms o’ the state, who care for you like fathers,When you curse them as enemies.#LBSFORGOLD
