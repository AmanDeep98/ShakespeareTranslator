So, your opinion is, Aufidius,That they of Rome are entered in our counselsAnd know how we proceed.Is it not yours?What ever have been thought on in this state,That could be brought to bodily act ere RomeHad circumvention? ’Tis not four days goneSince I heard thence; these are the words: I thinkI have the letter here; yes, here it is.‘They have press’d a power, but it is not knownWhether for east or west: the dearth is great;The people mutinous; and it is rumour’d,Cominius, Martius your old enemy,Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,These three lead on this preparationWhither ’tis bent: most likely ’tis for you:Consider of it.’Our army’s in the fieldWe never yet made doubt but Rome was readyTo answer us.#LBSFORGOLD
