Speak, good Cominius:Leave nothing out for length, and make us thinkRather our state’s defective for requitalThan we to stretch it out.(To the Tribunes)Masters o’ the people,We do request your kindest ears, and after,Your loving motion toward the common body,To yield what passes here.We are conventedUpon a pleasing treaty, and have heartsInclinable to honour and advanceThe theme of our assembly.Which the ratherWe shall be blest to do, if he rememberA kinder value of the people thanHe hath hereto prized them at.That’s off, that’s off;I would you rather had been silent. Please youTo hear Cominius speak?Most willingly;But yet my caution was more pertinentThan the rebuke you give it.#LBSFORGOLD
