I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. Iwill make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!Most sweet voices!Better it is to die, better to starve,Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to’t:What custom wills, in all things should we do’t,The dust on antique time would lie unswept,And mountainous error be too highly heaptFor truth to o’er-peer. Rather than fool it so,Let the high office and the honour goTo one that would do thus. I am half through;The one part suffer’d, the other will I do.Here come more voices.Your voices: for your voices I have fought;Watch’d for your voices; for your voices bearOf wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice sixI have seen and heard of; for your voices haveDone many things, some less, some more your voices:Indeed I would be consul.#LBSFORGOLD
