God save your good worships! Martius is cominghome: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?I’ the shoulder and i’ the left arm there will belarge cicatrices to show the people, when he shallstand for his place. He received in the repulse ofTarquin seven hurts i’ the body.One i’ the neck, and two i’ the thigh,—there’snine that I know.He had, before this last expedition, twenty-fivewounds upon him.Now it’s twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy’s grave.Hark! the trumpets.These are the ushers of Martius: before him hecarries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:Death, that dark spirit, in ’s nervy arm doth lie;Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.Know, Rome, that all alone Martius did fightWithin Corioli gates: where he hath won,With fame, a name to Caius Martius; theseIn honour follows Coriolanus.Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!#LBSFORGOLD
