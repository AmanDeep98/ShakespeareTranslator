Noble tribunes,It is the humane way: the other courseWill prove too bloody, and the end of itUnknown to the beginning.Noble Menenius,Be you then as the people’s officer.Masters, lay down your weapons.Go not home.Meet on the market-place. We’ll attend you there:Where, if you bring not Martius, we’ll proceedIn our first way.I’ll bring him to you.Let me desire your company: he must come,Or what is worst will follow.Pray you, let’s to him.#LBSFORGOLD
