You know the cause, air, of my standing here.We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to’t.Mine own desert.Your own desert!Ay, but not mine own desire.How not your own desire?No, sir,’twas never my desire yet to trouble thepoor with begging.You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope togain by you.Well then, I pray, your price o’ the consulship?The price is to ask it kindly.Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha’t: I have wounds toshow you, which shall be yours in private. Yourgood voice, sir; what say you?You shall ha’ it, worthy sir.A match, sir. There’s in all two worthy voicesbegged. I have your alms: adieu.But this is something odd.An ’twere to give again,--but ’tis no matter.#LBSFORGOLD
