There’s not a man I meet but doth salute meAs if I were their well-acquainted friend,And every one doth call me by my name.Some tender money to me; some invite me;Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;Some offer me commodities to buy.Even now a tailor called me in his shopAnd showed me silks that he had bought for me,And therewithal took measure of my body.Sure, these are but imaginary wiles,And lapland sorcerers inhabit here.Master, here’s The gold you sent me for. What, have you got
the picture of old Adam new-appareled?
What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?Not that Adam that kept the Paradise, but that Adam that
keeps the prison; he that goes in the calf’s skin that was
killed for the Prodigal; he that came behind you, sir, like an
evil angel, and bid you forsake your liberty.
I understand thee not.#LBSFORGOLDEvery person I meet greets me like an old friend, and every one of them knows my name. Some of them give me money, some invite me places, some thank me for the kind things I’ve done for them, some try to sell me things. Just now a tailor showed me fabrics he bought especially for me and then started to take my measurements. These are tricks of the imagination, and this place is filled with magicians.Here’s the money you wanted, master. Hey, have you gotten rid of that AdamDromio calls the officer “Adam” because, after Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden, Adam wore clothing made of skins, llike the officer’s leather uniform.Adam?What gold is this? Who’s this Adam you speak of?Not the Adam from the garden of Eden, but the Adam from the jailhouse. The one that wears leather clothes. The one that grabbed you and arrested you.I don’t know what you’re talking about.
