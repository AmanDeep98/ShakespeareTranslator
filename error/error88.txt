You gave me none. You wrong me much to say so.You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.Consider how it stands upon my credit.Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.I do, (to ANGELO) and charge you in the Duke’s name to obey me.This touches me in reputation.Either consent to pay this sum for me,Or I attach you by this officer.Consent to pay thee that I never had?—Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar’st.Here is thy fee. Arrest him, officer.I would not spare my brother in this caseIf he should scorn me so apparently.I do arrest you, sir. You hear the suit.I do obey thee till I give thee bail.But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dearAs all the metal in your shop will answer.Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus,To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.#LBSFORGOLDYou gave me nothing, and you wrong me by saying you did.You wrong me even more, sir, by denying it. Consider how poorly this reflects on me.Well, officer, I charge you to arrest him.I will. (to ANGELO) And I order you to obey me, in the name of the duke.This harms my reputation. Either pay this sum, Antipholus, or I’ll have this officer arrest you.Pay for something I never got? Go ahead, you fool. Arrest me if you dare.Officer, here’s your fee—arrest him. I would have my own brother arrested if he treated me so terribly.You’re under arrest, sir. You hear the charges.I’ll obey you until I can make bail. But Angelo, you’ll pay for this, even if it costs all the precious metals in your jewelry shop.Sir, the laws of Ephesus will be on my side, and you’ll be embarrassed. I’m certain of it.
