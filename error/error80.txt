I see a man here needs not live by shiftsWhen in the streets he meets such golden gifts.I’ll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay.If any ship put out, then straight away.#LBSFORGOLDguess there’s no need to be a thief in Ephesus.People come up to you in the street and hand you gold. I’ll go wait for Dromio at the marketplace. If any ships are sailing, I’ll get right on one.
