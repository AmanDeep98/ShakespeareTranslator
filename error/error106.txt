It is the devil.Nay, she is worse; she is the devil’s dam, and here she comes
in the habit of a light wench. And thereof comes that the
wenches say “God damn me” that’s as much to say “God
make me a light wench.” It is written they appear to men like
angels of light. Light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn:
ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.
Your man and you are marvelous merry, sir.Will you go with me? We’ll mend our dinner here.Master, if you do, expect spoon meat; or bespeak a long
spoon.
Why, Dromio?Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with the
devil.
(to COURTESAN) Avoid then, fiend! What tell’st thou me of supping?Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress.I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.Give me the ring of mine you had at dinnerOr, for my diamond, the chain you promised,And I’ll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.#LBSFORGOLDShe’s the devil.No, she’s worse: she’s the devil’s mother, and she comes to us disguised as an easy wench. And that’s why some women say, “God damn me,” which is the same thing as saying, “God make me an easy wench.” The Bible says the devil looks like an angel of light. But fire also gives off light, and fire will burn you. In other words, easy wenches will burn you. Keep away from this one.You and your servant are very funny, sir. Will you come with me? Can we finish our lunch?Master, if you eat with her, bring really long silverware.Why, Dromio?Because of the old saying: “He who eats with the devil needs a very long spoon.” You need to keep far away from them.(to COURTESAN) Get away, you demon! You talk about eating? You’re a sorceress, like everyone else here. I’ll conjure you, like a spell: get away from me.Give me back the ring I gave you at lunch, or give me the necklace you promised in exchange. Then I’ll be gone, sir, and stop troubling you.
