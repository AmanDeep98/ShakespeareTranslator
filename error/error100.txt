As if time were in debt. How fondly dost thou reason!Time is a very bankrout and owes more than he’s worth to  season.Nay, he’s a thief too. Have you not heard men sayThat time comes stealing on by night and day?If he be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?Go, Dromio. There’s the money. Bear it straight,And bring thy master home immediately.Come, sister, I am pressed down with conceit:Conceit, my comfort and my injury.#LBSFORGOLDTime’s not the one in debt. Your logic is so foolish.Time is always bankrupt: it owes more than it can ever pay back in a season. And Time’s a thief, too—don’t you know the old saying, “Time steals along”? So if Time is in debt and also a thief, and a cop comes, don’t you think Time would turn back an hour?Here’s the money, Dromio. Take it to your master and bring him home immediately. Come, sister, my imagination is too much for me: it both comforts me and depresses me.
