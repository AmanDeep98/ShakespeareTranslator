Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.I am an ass, I am a woman’s man, and besides myself.What woman’s man? And how besides thyself?Marry, sir, besides myself I am due to a woman, one that
claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.
What claim lays she to thee?Marry, sir, such claim as you would lay to your horse; and

You couldn’t even talk about it without saying, “I beg your pardon.”i.e., you’d have to say “I beg your pardon” when talking about her body because you’d have to use obscene language to discuss it.“I beg your pardon.” My luck would be running thin if I ended up with her, although she’d make it a fat marriage.What do you mean, a fat marriage?Sir, she works in the kitchen, so she’s oily. The only thing I could do with her is to use all that oil as fuel in a lamp and then use that light to run away by. Her
