You know since Pentecost the sum is due,And since I have not much importuned you,Nor now I had not, but that I am boundTo Persia, and want guilders for my voyage.Therefore make present satisfaction,Or I’ll attach you by this officer.Even just the sum that I do owe to youIs growing to me by Antipholus.And in the instant that I met with you,He had of me a chain. At five o'clockI shall receive the money for the same.Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,I will discharge my bond and thank you too.That labor may you save. See where he comes.While I go to the goldsmith’s house, go thouAnd buy a rope’s end. That will I bestowAmong my wife and her confederatesFor locking me out of my doors by day.But soft. I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone.Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.#LBSFORGOLDYou’ve owed me this money since the Pentecost holiday. I haven’t pressed you for it, and I wouldn’t now except that I’m going to Persia and I need money for the trip. So pay me now, or I’ll have this officer arrest you.Antipholus owes me the exact amount that I owe you. Just before I ran into you, I gave him a necklace. At five o'clock he’s going to pay me for it. Please, come to his house with me. I’ll pay what I owe you then and say thank you as well.He saves you the trouble: look, here he comes.
(to DROMIO) I’m going to the jeweler’s house. You go buy a piece of rope—I’ll whip my wife and her cohorts for locking me out of my own house. Wait a minute! I see the jeweler. Go, be gone with you. Buy a rope and bring it to me.
