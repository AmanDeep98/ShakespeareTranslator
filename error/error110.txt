Fear me not, man. I will not break away:I’ll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,To warrant thee, as I am ’rested for.My wife is in a wayward mood todayAnd will not lightly trust the messengerThat I should be attached in Ephesus.I tell you, ’twill sound harshly in her ears.Here comes my man. I think he brings the money.How now, sir? Have you that I sent you for?Here’s that, I warrant you, will pay them all.But where’s the money?Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?I’ll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?To a rope’s end, sir, and to that end am I returned.And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.

#LBSFORGOLDDon’t worry, man, I won’t try to escape. When it’s time for me to be freed, I’ll pay you the fee you’re entitled to for arresting me. My wife’s in a perverse mood today. She’ll be suspicious when the messenger tells her that I was arrested. I tell you, this will make her angry when she hears about it.Here’s my servant. I think he’s got the money. Hello there, sir! Do you have what I told you to get?Yes. And this rope will take care of everybody, I guarantee it.But where’s the money?Why, sir, I spent it on this rope.You idiot! Five hundred ducats for a rope?I can get you five hundred ropes for that price.Why did I just send you home?To get a piece of rope. And here I am, with that piece.And I’ll use that piece of rope to welcome you with. (beats DROMIO OF EPHESUS)
