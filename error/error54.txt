(within) Right, sir, I’ll tell you when an you tell me wherefore.Wherefore? For my dinner. I have not dined today.
(within) Nor today here you must not. Come again when you may.What art thou that keep’st me out from the house I owe?
(within) The porter for this time, sir, and my name is Dromio.O villain, thou hast stolen both mine office and my name!The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.If thou hadst been Dromio today in my place,Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name, or thy name  for an ass.
(within) What a coil is there, Dromio! Who are those at the gate?Let my master in, Luce.   (within) Faith, no, he comes too late,And so tell your master.   O Lord, I must laugh.Have at you with a proverb: shall I set in my staff?
(within) Have at you with another: that’s—When, can
you tell?

(from offstage) Right. Give me one good reason and I will.A reason? So I can eat lunch. I haven’t eaten today.
(from offstage) And you won’t eat here today. Come again some other time.Who do you think you are, keeping me out of my own house?
(from offstage) I’m the doorkeeper for the moment, and my name is Dromio.You jerk! You’ve stolen both my job and my name! True, the job never did me much good, and my name only ever got me in trouble. If you were the Dromio in my shoes today, you would have felt like you traded your head for a target and your name for the name of “Ass.”
(from offstage) What’s all the commotion, Dromio? Who’s at the door?Luce, let my master in.
(from offstage) No way, he’s too late. Tell your master that.Oh, Lord, this makes me laugh! I’ll come at you with the old proverb: “Should I make myself at home?”
(from offstage) I’ll come at you with another: “I’d like to see you try it!”
