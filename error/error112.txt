Good sir, be patient.Nay, ’tis for me to be patient. I am in adversity.Good now, hold thy tongue.Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.Thou whoreson, senseless villain.I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel your blows.Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an ass.I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long ears.—I
have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant,
and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows.
When I am cold, he heats me with beating; when I am warm,
he cools me with beating. I am waked with it when I sleep,
raised with it when I sit, driven out of doors with it when I
go from home, welcomed home with it when I return. Nay,
I bear it on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat, and I
think when he hath lamed me, I shall beg with it from door
to door.
Come, go along. My wife is coming yonder.#LBSFORGOLDGood sir, calm down.You should tell me to calm down—I’m the one who’s suffering here.Hold your tongue.No, you should tell him to hold his hands!You son of a bitch, senseless villain!I wish I were senseless, sir, so that I wouldn’t feel your punches!The only thing you can sense are punches—just like an ass.I am an ass, indeed: you can tell by my long ears. I’ve served this man from the moment I was born until this very instant, and all I’ve ever gotten from him are bruises. When I’m cold, his beatings keep me warm. When I’m hot, they keep me cool. He wakes me up by beating me, makes me stand by beating me, sends me out of the house and welcomes me back by beating me. Seriously, I carry beatings around with me like a beggar woman carries her baby. I figure that once he’s crippled me, I’ll beg by showing off my beatings.That’s enough. My wife’s coming.
