By what rule, sir?Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of FatherTime himself.Let’s hear it.There’s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald
by nature.
May he not do it by fine and recovery?Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and recover the lost hair of
another man.
Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is, so
plentiful an excrement?
Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts, and what
he hath scanted men in hair, he hath given them in wit.
Why, but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit.Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without
wit.
#LBSFORGOLDWhy not?I’ll tell you: it’s because of a law as plain as Father Time’s bald head.Let’s hear it.There may be a time for everything, but no man who has gone bald naturally can get his hair back.Can’t he get it by fine and recoveryFine and recovery = a legal term related to claiming ownership of private propertyfine and recovery?Yes, he can pay a fine for a wig and then recover another man’s lost hair.Why is Time so cheap about giving out hair? After all, it’s plentiful in its growth.Because animals are blessed with hair. With men, he’s been stingy with hair, but he makes up for it by giving them intelligence.But a lot of men have more hair than intelligence.And not one of them is smart enough to stop himself from going bald.So then, you must think that hairy men are honest and simpleminded.
