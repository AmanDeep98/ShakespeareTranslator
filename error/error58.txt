(within) Your wife, sir knave? Go, get you from the door.If you went in pain, master, this knave would go sore.Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome. We would  fain have either.In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.They stand at the door, master. Bid them welcome hither.There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold.It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold.Go, fetch me something: I’ll break ope the gate.
(within) Break any breaking here, and I’ll break your knave’s pate.A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.
(within) It seems thou want’st breaking. Out upon thee, hind!#LBSFORGOLD
(from offstage) Your wife, you scoundrel? Get away from the door.If she punishes you, master, she’s sure to punish me.It looks like we’re not going to get food or welcome here.We argued about which was best, and now we won’t get either one.Master, your guests are just standing here. Tell them they’re welcome.There’s something strange in the air that’s keeping us from getting in.And if your clothes were as thin as mine, you’d really feel the air. The food inside is warm, but you’re out here freezing. It would make any man as mad as a bull to be betrayed like this.Go get me something I can use to break down the door.
(from offstage) Break anything here and I’ll break your head.I’ll break words with you, sir. And since words are just wind, I’ll be breaking wind right in your face.
(from offstage) It seems you’re the one who needs to be broken. Be off with you, you dog!
