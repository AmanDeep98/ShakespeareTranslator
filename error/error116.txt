O husband, God doth know you dined at home,Where would you had remained until this time,Free from these slanders and this open shame.“Dined at home”? Thou villain, what sayest thou?Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.Were not my doors locked up and I shut out?Perdie, your doors were locked, and you shut out.And did not she herself revile me there?Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.Did not her kitchen maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?Certes, she did; the kitchen vestal scorned you.And did not I in rage depart from thence?In verity you did.—My bones bear witness,That since have felt the vigour of his rage.
(to PINCH) Is’t good to soothe him in these contraries?It is no shame. The fellow finds his veinAnd, yielding to him, humors well his frenzy.
(to ADRIANA) Thou hast suborned the goldsmith to arrest me.#LBSFORGOLDOh, husband, God himself knows you ate at home. I wish you had stayed there, avoiding these scandals and this public embarrassment!Ate at home? You there, rogue, what do you have to say about that?I swear, sir, you did not eat at home.My doors were locked and I was shut out, right?By God, your doors were locked and you were shut out.And she screamed at me, right?No lie—she screamed at you.And her cook yelled, mocked, and teased me, right?She sure did. The kitchen girl mocked you.And I departed in a rage, right?You truly did. My body can prove it because it felt the power of your anger.
(to PINCH) Should I try to soothe him by pretending to agree with his lies?Good idea. His servant here has figured out that agreeing is a good way to cope with his anger.
(to ADRIANA) You convinced the jeweler to arrest me.
