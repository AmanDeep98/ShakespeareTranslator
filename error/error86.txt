Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain.Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,And I, to blame, have held him here too long.Good Lord! You use this dalliance to excuseYour breach of promise to the Porpentine.I should have chid you for not bringing it,But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.The hour steals on. I pray you, sir, dispatch.You hear how he importunes me. The chain!Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.Come, come. You know I gave it you even now.Either send the chain, or send me by some token.Fie, now you run this humor out of breath.Come, where’s the chain? I pray you, let me see it.My business cannot brook this dalliance.
(to ANTIPHOLUS) Good sir, say whe'er you’ll answer me or no.If not, I’ll leave him to the Officer.I answer you? What should I answer you?The money that you owe me for the chain.I owe you none till I receive the chain.You know I gave it you half an hour since.#LBSFORGOLDListen, please, give me the necklace. This gentleman’s ready to go. The wind is right and it’s high tide, and I’ve delayed him a long time already.Good Lord! You’re using this as an excuse for not showing up at the Porcupine like you promised. I should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it, but you started fighting with me first.It’s getting late. Please, sir, hurry up.Antipholus, you hear how the man pleads with me. Give me the necklace!Give it to my wife, and get your money.Come, come. You know I gave it to you just now. Send the necklace to her, or send me with a token that will authorize her to pay me.Damn it, this isn’t funny. Where’s the necklace? Let me see it.My business cannot wait for this delay. (to ANTIPHOLUS) Good sir, tell me if you’re going to pay me. If not, I’ll turn this man over to the officer.Pay you? What should I pay you?The money you owe me for the necklace.I owe you nothing until I receive the necklace.You know that I gave it to you a half hour ago.
