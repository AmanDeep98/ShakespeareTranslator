You have prevailed. I will depart in quietAnd, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.I know a wench of excellent discourse,Pretty and witty, wild and yet, too, gentle.There will we dine. This woman that I mean,My wife—but, I protest, without desert—Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal;To her will we to dinner. (to ANGELO) Get you homeAnd fetch the chain; by this I know ’tis made.Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine,For there’s the house. That chain will I bestow—Be it for nothing but to spite my wife—Upon mine hostess there. Good sir, make haste.Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,I’ll knock elsewhere, to see if they’ll disdain me.I’ll meet you at that place some hour hence.Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.#LBSFORGOLDYou’re right—I’ll go quietly. And even though I’m in a distasteful mood, I’ll work on being happy. I know a terrific wench. She’s beautiful and charming—a little wild, but also gentle. We’ll eat at her place. My wife has accused me more than once of misbehaving with this woman. I swear to her that I haven’t, but it doesn’t change anything. We’ll go to her place for lunch. (to ANGELO) Go get the necklace, which I’m sure is done by now. Bring it to the Porcupine, where this woman is. I’ll to give it to her, just to spite my wife. Hurry, good sir. Since my own doors refuse to admit me, I’ll knock somewhere else and see if they turn me away as well.I’ll meet you there in an hour.Do that. This little prank of hers is going to cost me.
