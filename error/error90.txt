Master, there is a bark of EpidamnumThat stays but till her owner comes aboard,And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,I have conveyed aboard, and I have boughtThe oil, the balsamum and aqua vitae.The ship is in her trim; the merry windBlows fair from land. They stay for naught at allBut for their owner, master, and yourself.How now? A madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a ropeAnd told thee to what purpose and what end.You sent me for a rope’s end as soon.You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.I will debate this matter at more leisureAnd teach your ears to list me with more heed.To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight.Give her this key, and tell her in the deskThat’s cover’d o'er with Turkish tapestryThere is a purse of ducats. Let her send it.Tell her I am arrested in the street,And that shall bail me. Hie thee, slave. Begone.—On, officer, to prison till it come.#LBSFORGOLDMaster, there’s a ship from Epidamnum that’s going to set sail as soon as its owner gets on board. I’ve left our luggage on the ship, and I bought the oil, balm, and liquor you wanted. The ship is ready, the wind is up, and the sailors are only waiting for their owner and for you.What are you, a madman? You annoying idiot, what Epidamnum ship is waiting for me?A ship you sent me to find, to book passage out of here.You drunken slave, I sent you for a rope, and I told you what to do with it.Yeah, right—you sent me to get whipped. You sent me to the port to find a ship.I’ll debate this with you later, and then I’ll teach you to listen more carefully. Go to Adriana, you scoundrel, and quickly. Give her this key, and tell her that there’s money in the desk that’s covered with a Turkish tapestry. Have her send it to me. Tell her that I’ve been arrested and the money will be my bail. Hurry, you slave! Go! Officer, take me to prison until the money comes.
