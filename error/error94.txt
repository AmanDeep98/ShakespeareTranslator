Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eyeThat he did plead in earnest, yea or no?Looked he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?What observation mad’st thou in this caseOf his heart’s meteors tilting in his face?First he denied you had in him no right.He meant he did me none; the more my spite.Then swore he that he was a stranger here.And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.Then pleaded I for you.   And what said he?That love i begged for you he begged of me.With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?With words that in an honest suit might move.First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.Did’st speak him fair?#LBSFORGOLDOh, Luciana, did he tempt you like that? Could you tell from his face if he was serious? Yes or no? Did he look flushed or pale? Sad or happy? Could you tell from his looks what he was feeling in his heart?First, he said you had no right to him.He meant he did nothing right for me—which is true, unfortunately.Then he swore he was a stranger here.And that’s true—he is being strange. And yet he lies as well, for he’s no stranger.Then I pleaded for you.And what did he say?That he felt for me the love that I begged him to feel for you.How did he try to persuade you to love him?With words that—if they were spoken honestly—might have moved me. First, he praised my beauty, then my eloquence.Did you praise him as well?
