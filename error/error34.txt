“Why” first: for flouting me; and then “wherefore”:
for urging it the second time to me.
Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,When in the “why” and the “wherefore” is neither rhyme nor reason?Well, sir, I thank you.Thank me, sir, for what?Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.I’ll make you amends next, to give you nothing for
something. But say, sir, is it dinnertime?
No, sir, I think the meat wants that I have.In good time, sir, what’s that?Basting.Well, sir, then ’twill be dry.If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.Your reason?Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry
basting.
Well, sir, learn to jest in good time. There’s a time for all
things.
I durst have denied that before you were so choleric.#LBSFORGOLD“Why” first: for defying me. And then “wherefore”: for doing it a second time.I don’t think any man’s ever been beaten for a “why” and “wherefore” that made so little sense. Well, thank you.Thank me? For what?Because you gave me something for nothing.Next time I’ll give you nothing for something. Is it lunchtime?No. The meat lacks something that I have.What would that be?A basting.Well, then it will be dry.If it is, I suggest you don’t eat it.Why not?Because it will make you angry, and that will get me another beating.Well, learn to make jokes at the appropriate time. There’s a time for all things.Before you got so angry, I never would have thought that.
