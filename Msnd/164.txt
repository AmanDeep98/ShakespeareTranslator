Now is the mural down between the two neighbors.No remedy, my lord, when walls are so willful to hear without
                                warning.This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.The best in this kind are but shadows, and the worst are no worse
                                if imagination amend them.It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves,
they may pass for excellent men. Here come two noble
beasts in, a man and a lion.

You, ladies, you whose gentle hearts do fearThe smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,May now perchance both quake and tremble here,When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.Then know that I, as Snug the joiner, amA lion fell, nor else no lion’s dam.For if I should as lion come in strifeInto this place, ’twere pity on my life.A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.A very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I
                            saw.#LBSFORGOLDThe lovers should’ve waited around a little
                                longer—the wall between them is down now.What can you do? That’s what happens with talking
                                walls.This is the silliest thing I’ve ever seen.The best plays are still only illusions, and the worst are just as
                                good, if you just use your imagination to fill them in.In that case it’s your imagination that’s
                                interesting, not the play.If we imagine these guys as they imagine themselves, then
                                they’re first-class actors. Look, here come two noble
                                animals, a man and a lion.

                                hearts make you afraid of the smallest monstrous mouse that crawls
                                around on the floor, might quake and tremble now when the wild lion
                                roars in his most violent rage. You should know that I, Snug the
                                carpenter, am not a fierce lion or a lioness, because if I were a
                                lion and I showed up here to cause trouble, I’d be taking
                                my life in my hands.Ah, it’s a sensitive animal, with a good
                            conscience.He’s the best actor I’ve ever seen play a
                                lion.
