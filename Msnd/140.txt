It shall be called
                            “Bottom’s Dream” because it hath no
                            bottom. And I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke. Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing
                                it at her death.

                            call it “Bottom’s Dream” because
                            it’s so deep that it has no bottom. And I’ll
                            sing it for the duke in the intermission of a play. Or maybe, to make it even more lovely, I’ll sing it when the
                                heroine dies.
