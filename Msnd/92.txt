Flower of this purple dye,Hit with Cupid’s archery,Sink in apple of his eye.When his love he doth espy,Let her shine as gloriouslyAs the Venus of the sky.When thou wakest, if she be by,Beg of her for remedy.Captain of our fairy band,Helena is here at hand,And the youth, mistook by me,Pleading for a lover’s fee.Shall we their fond pageant see?Lord, what fools these mortals be!Stand aside. The noise they makeWill cause Demetrius to awake.Then will two at once woo one.That must needs be sport alone.And those things do best please meThat befall preposterously.Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?Scorn and derision never come in tears.#LBSFORGOLD

You purple flower, hit by Cupid’s arrow, sink into the
                                pupils of this man’s eyes. When he sees the girl he
                                should love, make her seem as bright to him as the evening star.
                                Young man, when you wake up, if she’s nearby, beg her to
                                cure your lovesickness.Helena is nearby, boss. The young man who I mistook for this one
                                is there too, begging her to love him. Should we watch this
                                ridiculous scene? Lord, what fools these mortals are!Step aside. The noise they’re making will wake up
                                Demetrius.Then the two of them will both pursue one girl. That will be funny
                                enough, and preposterous situations are my favorite thing.Why do you think I’m making fun of you when I tell you
                                I love you? People don’t cry when they’re
                                mocking someone.
