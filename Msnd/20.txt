And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight.Then to the wood will he tomorrow nightPursue her. And for this intelligenceIf I have thanks, it is a dear expense.But herein mean I to enrich my pain,To have his sight thither and back again.#LBSFORGOLDBut when he got all hot and bothered 
                            over Hermia, his promises melted away. I’ll go tell
                                Demetrius that Hermia is running away tomorrow night.
                                He’ll run after her. If he’s grateful to me
                                for this information, it’ll be worth my pain in helping
                                him pursue my rival Hermia. At least I’ll get to see him
                                when he goes, and then again when he comes back.
