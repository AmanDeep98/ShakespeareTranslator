Ready. And I.  And I.    And I.Where shall we go?Be kind and courteous to this gentleman.Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes.Feed him with apricoks and dewberries,With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries.The honey bags steal from the humble-bees,And for night tapers crop their waxen thighsAnd light them at the fiery glowworms' eyesTo have my love to bed and to arise.And pluck the wings from painted butterfliesTo fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.Hail, mortal.  Hail.    Hail.      Hail.I cry your worships' mercy, heartily.—I
                                beseech your worship’s name.#LBSFORGOLDReady.Me too.Me too.And me too.Where should we go?Be kind and polite to this gentleman. Follow him around. Leap and
                                dance for him. Feed him apricots and blackberries, with purple
                                grapes, green figs, and mulberries. Steal honey from the bumblebees,
                                and make candles out of the bees' wax. Light them with
                                the light of glowworms, so my love will have light when he goes to
                                bed and wakes up. Pluck off colorful butterfly wings, and use them
                                to fan moonbeams away from his eyes as he sleeps. Bow to him,
                                fairies, and curtsy to him.Hello, mortal!Hello!Hello!Hello!I beg your pardon, sirs.—Please tell me your name,
                            sir?
