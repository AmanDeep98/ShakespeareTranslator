So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckleGently entwist. The female ivy soEnrings the barky fingers of the elm.Oh, how I love thee! How I dote on thee!Welcome, good Robin. Seest thou this sweet sight?Her dotage now I do begin to pity.For, meeting her of late behind the wood,Seeking sweet favors from this hateful fool,I did upbraid her and fall out with her.For she his hairy temples then had roundedWith a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers,And that same dew, which sometime on the budsWas wont to swell like round and orient pearls,Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyesLike tears that did their own disgrace bewail.When I had at my pleasure taunted herAnd she in mild terms begged my patience,I then did ask of her her changeling child,Which straight she gave me and her fairy sentTo bear him to my bower in Fairyland.And now I have the boy, I will undoThis hateful imperfection of her eyes.And, gentle Puck, take this transformèd scalpFrom off the head of this Athenian swain,That, he awaking when the other do,May all to Athens back again repairAnd think no more of this night’s accidentsBut as the fierce vexation of a dream.But first I will release the fairy queen.#LBSFORGOLDI’m putting my arms around you just like the woodbine
                                tendril gently twists itself around the sweet honeysuckle, and like
                                the female ivy curls itself around the branches of the elm tree. Oh,
                                how I love you! I’m so crazy about you!Welcome, good Robin. Do you see this sweet sight? Now
                                I’m starting to pity Titania for being so infatuated. I
                                ran into her recently at the edge of the forest, looking for sweet
                                presents for this hateful idiot, and I scolded her and argued with
                                her. She had put a wreath of fresh, fragrant flowers around his
                                hairy forehead, and the drops of dew that lay in the center of the
                                flowers made the flowers look like they were crying with shame to be
                                decorating the head of that ugly jackass. When I had taunted her as
                                much as I wanted to, and she begged me very nicely to leave her
                                alone, I asked her for the stolen Indian child. She said yes right
                                away, and sent a fairy to bring him to my home in Fairyland. And now
                                that I have the boy, I’ll undo the spell that makes her
                                vision so disgustingly wrong. And, gentle Puck, take this
                                transformed ass’s head off of the head of that Athenian
                                man, so that when he wakes up at the same time as the rest of them
                                do, they can all go back to Athens. They’ll only remember
                                the events of tonight as a very unpleasant dream. But first
                                I’ll release the fairy queen from the spell.
