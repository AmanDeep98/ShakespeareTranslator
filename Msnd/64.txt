                                me! Do thy bestTo pluck this crawling serpent from my breast.Ay me, for pity! What a dream was here.Lysander, look how I do quake with fear.Methought a serpent eat my heart away,And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.Lysander!—What, removed?—Lysander,
                                lord!—What, out of hearing, gone? No sound, no word?—Alack, where are you? Speak, an if you hear.Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.No? Then I well perceive you all not nigh.Either death or you I’ll find immediately.#LBSFORGOLD
(waking up) Help me, Lysander, help
                                me! Get this snake off of my chest. Oh, my God! What a terrible
                                dream I just had! Lysander, look how I’m shaking from
                                fear. I thought a snake was eating my heart while you sat smiling
                                and watching. Lysander!—What, is he
                                gone?—Lysander, my lord!—What, is he out of
                                earshot? Gone? No answer, nothing? Oh, God, where are you? Say
                                something if you can hear me. Say something, please! I’m
                                almost fainting with fear. Nothing? Then I guess you’re
                                nowhere nearby. I’ll find you—or
                                die—right away.
