Well, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this groveTill I torment thee for this
                                injury.—(to ROBIN
                                GOODFELLOW)
My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberestSince once I sat upon a promontoryAnd heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s backUttering such dulcet and harmonious breathThat the rude sea grew civil at her songAnd certain stars shot madly from their spheresTo hear the seamaid’s music?    I remember.That very time I saw (but thou couldst not)Flying between the cold moon and the Earth,Cupid all armed. A certain aim he tookAt a fair vestal thronèd by the west,And loosed his love shaft smartly from his bowAs it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaftQuenched in the chaste beams of the watery moon,And the imperial votaress passèd on,In maiden meditation, fancy-free.Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell.It fell upon a little western flower,Before milk-white, now purple with love’s wound.And maidens call it “love-in-idleness.”Fetch me that flower. The herb I showed thee once.The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laidWill make or man or woman madly doteUpon the next live creature that it sees.Fetch me this herb, and be thou here againEre the leviathan can swim a league.I’ll put a girdle round about the EarthIn forty minutes.#LBSFORGOLDWell, go on your way, then. You won’t leave this grove
                                until I’ve paid you back for this insult.
                                (to ROBIN
                                GOODFELLOW) My dear Puck, come here.
                                You remember the time when I was sitting on a cliff, and I heard a
                                mermaid sitting on a dolphin’s back sing such a sweet and
                                harmonious song that it calmed the stormy sea and made stars shoot
                                out of the sky so they could hear her better?Yes, I remember.That same night, I saw Cupid flying from the moon to the earth,
                                with all of his arrows ready. (You couldn’t see him, but
                                I could.) He took aim at a beautiful young virgin who was sitting on
                                a throne in the western part of the world, and he shot his arrow of
                                love well enough to have pierced a hundred thousand hearts. But I
                                could see that Cupid’s fiery arrow was put out by watery,
                                virginal moonbeams, so the royal virgin continued her virginal
                                thoughts without being interrupted by thoughts of love. But I paid
                                attention to where Cupid’s arrow fell. It fell on a
                                little western flower, which used to be white as milk but now has
                                turned purple from being wounded by the arrow of love. Young girls
                                call it “love-in-idleness.” Bring me that
                                flower. I showed it to you once. If its juice is put on
                                someone’s eyelids while they’re asleep, that
                                person will fall in love with the next living creature he or she
                                sees. Bring me this plant, and get back here before the sea monster
                                has time to swim three miles.I could go around the world in forty minutes.
