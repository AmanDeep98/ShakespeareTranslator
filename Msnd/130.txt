Fairy King, attend, and mark.I do hear the morning lark.Then, my queen, in silence sad,Trip we after the night’s shade.We the globe can compass soonSwifter than the wandering moon.Come, my lord, and in our flightTell me how it came this nightThat I sleeping here was foundWith these mortals on the ground.Go, one of you, find out the forester.For now our observation is performed.And since we have the vaward of the day,My love shall hear the music of my hounds.Uncouple in the western valley. Let them go.Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.We will, fair queen, up to the mountain’s top,And mark the musical confusionOf hounds and echo in conjunction.I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,When in a wood of Crete they bayed the bearWith hounds of Sparta. Never did I hearSuch gallant chiding. For, besides the groves,#LBSFORGOLDListen, Fairy King. I can hear the lark singing.
                                Morning’s here.In that case, my queen, let’s travel silently and
                                solemnly across the globe to where it’s still night,
                                circling the earth faster than the moon does.While we’re walking, you can tell me how I ended up
                                sleeping on the ground with these humans last night.One of you go find the forest ranger. Since we’re done
                                with the May Day rites and it’s still so early in the
                                morning, my love will have a chance to hear the beautiful music of
                                my hunting dogs barking as they chase their prey. Unleash the dogs
                                in the western valley. Let them go. Now go find the forest
                            ranger.My beautiful queen, we’ll go up the mountain and listen
                                to the hounds as their barking echoes in the cliffs and sounds like
                                music.I was with the heroes Hercules and Cadmus once, when their Spartan
                                hunting dogs cornered a bear. I’d never heard such
                                impressive barking before.
