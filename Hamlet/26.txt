And with no less nobility of loveThan that which dearest father bears his sonDo I impart toward you. For your intentIn going back to school in Wittenberg,It is most retrograde to our desire.And we beseech you, bend you to remainHere in the cheer and comfort of our eye,Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.I pray thee, stay with us. Go not to Wittenberg.I shall in all my best obey you, madam.Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply.Be as ourself in Denmark.—Madam, come.This gentle and unforced accord of HamletSits smiling to my heart, in grace whereofNo jocund health that Denmark drinks todayBut the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,And the king’s rouse the heavens shall bruit again,Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.Oh, that this too, too sullied flesh would melt,Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew,Or that the Everlasting had not fixedHis canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God, God!How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitableSeem to me all the uses of this world!Fie on ’t, ah fie! 'Tis an unweeded gardenThat grows to seed. Things rank and gross in naturePossess it merely. That it should come to this.But two months dead—nay, not so much, not two.So excellent a king, that was to thisHyperion to a satyr. So loving to my mother#LBSFORGOLDBecause everyone knows that you are the man closest to this
                                throne, and I love you just as much as any father loves his son. And
                                your plans for going back to Wittenberg are not what I want.
                                I’m asking you now to stay here in my company as the
                                number-one member of my court, my nephew and now my son too.Please answer my prayers, Hamlet, and stay with us.
                                Don’t go back to Wittenberg.I’ll obey you as well as I can,
                            ma'am.That’s the right answer—it shows your love.
                                Stay in Denmark like us.—My dear wife, come.
                                Hamlet’s agreeing to stay makes me happy, and every merry
                                toast I’ll drink today will be heard as far as the clouds
                                overhead. My drinking will be echoed in the heavens.
                                Let’s go.Ah, I wish my dirty flesh could melt away into a vapor, or that
                                God had not made a law against suicide. Oh God, God! How tired,
                                stale, and pointless life is to me. Damn it! It’s like a
                                garden that no one’s taking care of, and
                                that’s growing wild. Only nasty weeds grow in it now. I
                                can’t believe it’s come to this. My
                                father’s only been dead for two months—no, not
                                even two. Such an excellent king, as superior to my uncle as a god
                                is to a beast, and so loving toward my mother that he kept the wind
                                from blowing too hard on her face.
