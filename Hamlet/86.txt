Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.Moreover that we much did long to see you,The need we have to use you did provokeOur hasty sending. Something have you heardOf Hamlet’s
                                “transformation”—so call itSince nor th' exterior nor the inward manResembles that it was. What it should be,More than his father’s death, that thus hath put himSo much from th' understanding of himself,I cannot dream of. I entreat you bothThat, being of so young days brought up with himAnd since so neighbored to his youth and 'havior,That you vouchsafe your rest here in our courtSome little time so by your companiesTo draw him on to pleasures and to gather,So much as from occasion you may glean,Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thusThat, opened, lies within our remedy.Good gentlemen, he hath much talked of you.And sure I am two men there are not livingTo whom he more adheres. If it will please youTo show us so much gentry and good willAs to expend your time with us awhileFor the supply and profit of our hope,Your visitation shall receive such thanksAs fits a king’s remembrance.#LBSFORGOLDWelcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. I’ve wanted
                                to see you for a long time now, but I sent for you so hastily
                                because I need your help right away. You’ve probably
                                heard about the “change” that’s
                                come over Hamlet—that’s the only word for it,
                                since inside and out he’s different from what he was
                                before. I can’t imagine what’s made him so
                                unlike himself, other than his father’s death. Since you
                                both grew up with him and are so familiar with his personality and
                                behavior, I’m asking you to stay a while at court and
                                spend some time with him. See if you can get Hamlet to have some
                                fun, and find out if there’s anything in particular
                                that’s bothering him, so we can set about trying to fix
                                it.Gentlemen, Hamlet’s talked a lot about you, and I know
                                there are no two men alive he’s fonder of. If
                                you’ll be so good as to spend some time with us and help
                                us out, you’ll be thanked on a royal scale.
