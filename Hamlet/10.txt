Good now, sit down and tell me, he that knows,Why this same strict and most observant watchSo nightly toils the subject of the land,And why such daily cast of brazen cannonAnd foreign mart for implements of war,Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore taskDoes not divide the Sunday from the week.What might be toward, that this sweaty hasteDoth make the night joint laborer with the day?Who is ’t that can inform me?    That can I.At least, the whisper goes so: our last king,Whose image even but now appeared to us,Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,Thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride,Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet(For so this side of our known world esteemed him)Did slay this Fortinbras, who by a sealed compactWell ratified by law and heraldry,Did forfeit, with his life, all those his landsWhich he stood seized of to the conqueror,Against the which a moiety competentWas gagèd by our king, which had returnedTo the inheritance of FortinbrasHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same covenantAnd carriage of the article designed,His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,Of unimprovèd mettle hot and full,Hath in the skirts of Norway here and thereSharked up a list of lawless resolutes,For food and diet, to some enterpriseThat hath a stomach in ’t, which is no
                                other—As it doth well appear unto our state—But to recover of us, by strong hand#LBSFORGOLDAll right, let’s sit down and discuss that question.
                                Somebody tell me why this strict schedule of guards has been
                                imposed, and why so many bronze cannons are being manufactured in
                                Denmark, and so many weapons bought from abroad, and why the
                                shipbuilders are so busy they don’t even rest on Sunday.
                                Is something about to happen that warrants working this night and
                                day? Who can explain this to me?I can. Or at least I can describe the rumors. As you know, our
                                late king, whom we just now saw as a ghost, was the great rival of
                                Fortinbras, king of Norway. Fortinbras dared him to battle. In that
                                fight, our courageous Hamlet (or at least that’s how we
                                thought of him) killed old King Fortinbras, who—on the
                                basis of a valid legal document—surrendered all his
                                territories, along with his life, to his conqueror. If our king had
                                lost, he would have had to do the same. But now old
                                Fortinbras’s young son, also called
                                Fortinbras—he is bold, but unproven—has
                                gathered a bunch of thugs from the lawless outskirts of the country.
                                For some food, they’re eager to take on the tough
                                enterprise of securing the lands the elder Fortinbras lost.
