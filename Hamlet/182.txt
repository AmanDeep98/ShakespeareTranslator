God bless you, sir.My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a
                                camel?By th' mass, and ’tis like a camel
                            indeed.Methinks it is like a weasel.It is backed like a weasel.Or like a whale.Very like a whale.Then I will come to my mother by and by.
                                (aside) They fool
me to the top of my bent.—I will come by and by.
I will say so.“By and by” is easily said.Leave me, friends.'Tis now the very witching time of night,When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes outContagion to this world. Now could I drink hot bloodAnd do such bitter business as the bitter dayWould quake to look on. Soft, now to my mother.—O heart, lose not thy nature, let not everThe soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.Let me be cruel, not unnatural.#LBSFORGOLDHello and God bless you, sir.My lord, the queen wants to speak with you right away.Do you see that cloud up there that looks like a camel?By God, it does look like a camel.To me it looks like a weasel.It does have a back like a weasel’s.Or like a whale.Yes, very much like a whale.I’ll go see my mother soon.

                                They’re trying as hard as they can to mess with
                                me.—I will go soon.I’ll tell her.It’s easy enough to say
                            “soon.”Now please leave me alone, my friends.This is the time of night when witches come out, when graveyards
                                yawn open and the stench of hell seeps out. I could drink hot blood
                                and do such terrible deeds that people would tremble even in the
                                daylight. But I’ve got to go see my
                                mother.—Oh, heart, don’t grow weak, like NeroNero was a Roman emperor known for his extreme cruelty.Nero Let me be cruel, but not inhuman.
