Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s deathThe memory be green, and that it us befittedTo bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdomTo be contracted in one brow of woe,Yet so far hath discretion fought with natureThat we with wisest sorrow think on himTogether with remembrance of ourselves.Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,Have we—as ’twere with a defeated joy,With an auspicious and a dropping eye,With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,In equal scale weighing delight and dole—Taken to wife. Nor have we herein barredYour better wisdoms, which have freely goneWith this affair along. For all, our thanks.Now follows that you know. Young Fortinbras,Holding a weak supposal of our worthOr thinking by our late dear brother’s deathOur state to be disjoint and out of frame,Colleaguèd with the dream of his advantage,He hath not failed to pester us with messageImporting the surrender of those landsLost by his father, with all bonds of law,To our most valiant brother. So much for him.Now for ourself and for this time of meeting#LBSFORGOLDAlthough I still have fresh memories of my brother the elder
                                Hamlet’s death, and though it was proper to mourn him
                                throughout our kingdom, life still goes on—I think
                                it’s wise to mourn him while also thinking about my own
                                well being. Therefore, I’ve married my former
                                sister-in-law, the queen, with mixed feelings of happiness and
                                sadness. I know that in marrying Gertrude I’m only doing
                                what all of you have wisely advised all along—for which I
                                thank you. Now, down to business. You all know what’s
                                happening. Young Fortinbras, underestimating my strength or
                                imagining that the death of the king has thrown my country into
                                turmoil, dreams of getting the better of me, and never stops
                                pestering me with demands that I surrender the territory his father
                                lost to the elder Hamlet, my dead brother-in-law. So much for
                                Fortinbras.Now, here’s what needs to be done.
