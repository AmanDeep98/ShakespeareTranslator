Belike this show imports the argument of the play.We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep
counsel. They’ll tell all.
Will he tell us what this show meant?Ay, or any show that you will show him. Be not you
ashamed to show, he’ll not shame to tell you what it
                                means.
You are naught, you are naught. I’ll mark the
                            play.
For us and for our tragedy,
Here stooping to your clemency,
We beg your hearing
                            patiently.Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring?'Tis brief, my lord.As woman’s love.#LBSFORGOLDThis pantomime was probably a summary of the play.This guy will tell us everything. Actors can’t keep a
                                secret. They’ll tell all.Will he tell us what that pantomime meant?Sure, or anything else you show him. As long as you
                                aren’t ashamed to show it, he won’t be ashamed
                                to tell you what it means.You’re naughty. I’m watching the
                            play.
We beg you most courteously

To be patient with us

And watch our humble
                            tragedy.Was that the prologue or the inscription on some wedding
                            ring?It was a bit short, my lord.Yes, as short as a woman’s love.
