At last, a little shaking of mine armAnd thrice his head thus waving up and down,He raised a sigh so piteous and profoundAs it did seem to shatter all his bulkAnd end his being. That done, he lets me go,And, with his head over his shoulder turned,He seemed to find his way without his eyes,For out o' doors he went without their helps,And to the last bended their light on me.Come, go with me. I will go seek the king.This is the very ecstasy of love,Whose violent property fordoes itselfAnd leads the will to desperate undertakingsAs oft as any passion under heavenThat does afflict our natures. I am sorry.What, have you given him any hard words of late?No, my good lord. But as you did commandI did repel his fetters and deniedHis access to me.  That hath made him mad.I am sorry that with better heed and judgmentI had not quoted him. I feared he did but trifleAnd meant to wreck thee. But beshrew my jealousy!By heaven, it is as proper to our ageTo cast beyond ourselves in our opinionsAs it is common for the younger sortTo lack discretion. Come, go we to the king.This must be known, which, being kept close, might moveMore grief to hide than hate to utter love.Come.#LBSFORGOLDFinally, after shaking my arm a little, and jerking his head up
                                and down three times, he sighed like it was his last breath. After
                                that he let me go. He left the room with his head turned back on me,
                                finding his way out without looking, since his eyes were on me the
                                whole time.Come with me. I’ll go tell the king about this. This is
                                definitely love-craziness. Love is such a violent emotion that it
                                makes people self-destruct, as much as any strong emotion.
                                I’m so sorry. Did you tell him anything that might have
                                hurt his feelings lately?No, father, but I did what you told me to do and sent back his
                                letters and wouldn’t let him visit me.That’s what made him crazy. I regret not observing him
                                more closely before I told you to do that. I thought he was just
                                toying with you and meant to ruin your reputation. Damn my
                                suspicious thoughts! It’s as common for us old people to
                                assume we know more than we do as for young people to be too wild
                                and crazy. Come on, let’s go see the king.
                                We’ve got to discuss this matter, which could cause more
                                trouble if we keep it secret than if we discuss it openly.
