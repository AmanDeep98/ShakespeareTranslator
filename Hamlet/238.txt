Conceit upon her father.Pray you, let’s have no words of this, but when they

 Tomorrow is Saint
                                    Valentine’s day,  All in the morning
                                    betime, And I a maid at your
                                window,  To be your
                                    Valentine. Then up he rose, and donned his
                                    clothes,  And dupped the
                                    chamber door. Let in the maid that out a
                                maid
  Never departed

 Young men will do
                                    ’t, if they come to ’t.  By Cock, they are

                                    you tumbled me,  You promised me to
                                    wed.”
 He answers, “So would I
                                    ha' done, by yonder sun,  An thou hadst not
                                    come to my bed.”

 I’m a girl below
                                    your window
  Waiting to be your
                                    Valentine. Then he got up and put on his
                                    clothes
  And opened the door
                                    to his room. He let in the girl, and when

                                    shame it is, Young men will do it if they
                                    get a chance:
  By God,
                                    they’re very bad. She said, “Before
                                    you got me into bed,  You promised to
                                    marry me.”
 He answers:
 “I would have
                                    married you, I swear,  If you
                                    hadn’t gone to bed with
                            me.”
