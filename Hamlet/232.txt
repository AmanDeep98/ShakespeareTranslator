Of thinking too precisely on th' event—A thought which, quartered, hath but one part wisdomAnd ever three parts coward—I do not knowWhy yet I live to say “This thing’s to
                                do,”Sith I have cause and will and strength and meansTo do ’t. Examples gross as earth exhort me.Witness this army of such mass and chargeLed by a delicate and tender prince,Whose spirit with divine ambition puffedMakes mouths at the invisible event,Exposing what is mortal and unsureTo all that fortune, death, and danger dare,Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be greatIs not to stir without great argument,But greatly to find quarrel in a strawWhen honor’s at the stake. How stand I then,That have a father killed, a mother stained,Excitements of my reason and my blood,And let all sleep—while, to my shame, I seeThe imminent death of twenty thousand men,That for a fantasy and trick of fameGo to their graves like beds, fight for a plotWhereon the numbers cannot try the cause,Which is not tomb enough and continentTo hide the slain? Oh, from this time forth,My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!#LBSFORGOLDthat comes from thinking too much (thinking thoughts that are one
                                part wisdom, three parts cowardice), I don’t know why
                                I’m still alive to say “I have to do this
                                deed” rather than having done it already. I have the
                                motivation, the willpower, the ability, and the means to do it.
                                It’s as plain as the ground beneath my feet that I must
                                do it. Look at this massive army led by a delicate and tender prince
                                who’s so puffed up with divine ambition that he puts his
                                fragile life at risk, exposing it to danger and death, for a reason
                                as thin as an eggshell. To be truly great doesn’t mean
                                you’d only fight for a good reason. It means
                                you’d fight over nothing if your honor was at stake. So
                                where does that leave me, whose father has been murdered and mother
                                defiled, ignoring these mental and emotional provocations and
                                letting well enough alone? Meanwhile, to my shame, I watch twenty
                                thousand men go marching to their deaths for an illusion and a
                                little bit of fame, fighting for a tiny piece of land not even big
                                enough to bury them all. From now on, if my thoughts
                                aren’t violent I’ll consider them
                            worthless.
