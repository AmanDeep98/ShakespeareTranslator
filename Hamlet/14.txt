If there be any good thing to be doneThat may to thee do ease and grace to me,Speak to me.If thou art privy to thy country’s fate,Which happily foreknowing may avoid,Oh, speak!Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy lifeExtorted treasure in the womb of earth,For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,Speak of it. Stay and speak!    —Stop
                                it, Marcellus.Shall I strike at it with my partisan?Do, if it will not stand.   'Tis here.    'Tis
                                here.'Tis gone.We do it wrong, being so majestical,To offer it the show of violence,For it is, as the air, invulnerable,And our vain blows malicious mockery.It was about to speak when the cock crew.#LBSFORGOLDIf there’s any good deed I can do that will bring you
                                peace and me honor, speak to me. If you have some secret knowledge
                                of your country’s sad fate—which might be
                                avoided if we knew about it—then, please, speak. Or if
                                you’ve got some buried treasure somewhere, which they say
                                often makes ghosts restless, then tell us about it. Stay and
                            speak!Keep it from leaving, Marcellus.Should I strike it with my spear?Yes, if it doesn’t stand still.It’s over here.There it is.It’s gone. We were wrong to threaten it with violence,
                                since it looks so much like a king. Besides, we can’t
                                hurt it anymore than we can hurt the air. Our attack was stupid,
                                futile, and wicked.It was about to say something when the rooster crowed.
