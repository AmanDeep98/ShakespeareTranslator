May be the devil, and the devil hath powerT' assume a pleasing shape. Yea, and perhapsOut of my weakness and my melancholy,As he is very potent with such spirits,Abuses me to damn me. I’ll have groundsMore relative than this. The play’s the thingWherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.#LBSFORGOLDMurder has no tongue, but miraculously it still finds a way to
                                speak. I’ll have these actors perform something like my
                                father’s murder in front of my uncle. I’ll
                                watch my uncle. I’ll probe his conscience and see if he
                                flinches. If he becomes pale, I know what to do. The ghost I saw may
                                be the devil, and the devil has the power to assume a pleasing
                                disguise, and so he may be taking advantage of my weakness and
                                sadness to bring about my damnation. I need better evidence than the
                                ghost to work with. The play’s the thing to uncover the
                                conscience of the king.
