To give the world assurance of a man.This was your husband. Look you now, what follows.Here is your husband, like a mildewed earBlasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?Could you on this fair mountain leave to feedAnd batten on this moor? Ha, have you eyes?You cannot call it love, for at your ageThe heyday in the blood is tame, it’s humble,And waits upon the judgment. And what judgmentWould step from this to this? Sense sure you have,Else could you not have motion. But sure that senseIs apoplexed, for madness would not err,Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thralled,But it reserved some quantity of choiceTo serve in such a difference. What devil was ’tThat thus hath cozened you at hoodman-blind?Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,Or but a sickly part of one true senseCould not so mope. O shame, where is thy blush?Rebellious hell,If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,To flaming youth let virtue be as waxAnd melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shameWhen the compulsive ardor gives the charge,Since frost itself as actively doth burn,And reason panders will.    O Hamlet, speak no
                                more!Thou turn’st mine eyes into my very soul,And there I see such black and grainèd spotsAs will not leave their tinct.    Nay, but to liveIn the rank sweat of an enseamèd bed,Stewed in corruption, honeying and making loveOver the nasty sty—#LBSFORGOLDThat was your husband. Now look at this other one. Here is your
                                present husband, like a mildewed ear of corn infecting the healthy
                                one next to it. Do you have eyes? How could you leave the lofty
                                heights of this man here and descend as low as this one? Ha! Do you
                                have eyes? You cannot say you did it out of love, since at your age
                                romantic passions have grown weak, and the heart obeys reason. But
                                what reason could move you from this one to that one? You must have
                                some sense in your head, since you’re able to get around,
                                but it seems to be paralyzed, since even if you were crazy you would
                                know the difference between these two men. No one ever went so
                                insane that they couldn’t get an easy choice like this
                                one right. What devil was it that blindfolded you? Eyes without
                                feeling, feeling without sight, ears without hands or eyes, smell
                                without anything else, the use of even one impaired sense would not
                                permit such a mistake as yours. Oh, for shame, why aren’t
                                you blushing? If evil can overtake even an old mother’s
                                bones, then let it melt my own. It turns out it’s no
                                longer shameful to act on impulse—now that the old are
                                doing so, and now that reason is a servant to desire.Oh, Hamlet, stop! You’re making me look into my very
                                soul, where the marks of sin are so thick and black they will never
                                be washed away.Yes, and you lie in the sweaty stench of your dirty sheets, wet
                                with corruption, making love—
