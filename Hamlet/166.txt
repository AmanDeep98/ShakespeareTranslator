The instances that second marriage
                                move

Are base respects of thrift, but none of
                                    love.
A second time I kill my husband dead

When second husband kisses me in
                                bed.
I do believe you think what now you
                                speak,
But what we do determine oft we
                                break.
Purpose is but the slave to memory,
Of violent birth, but poor
                                validity,
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the
                                    tree,
But fall, unshaken, when they mellow
                                be.
Most necessary ’tis that we
                                forget

To pay ourselves what to ourselves is
                                debt.
What to ourselves in passion we
                                propose,
The passion ending, doth the purpose
                                lose.
The violence of either grief or joy

Their own enactures with themselves
                                destroy.
Where joy most revels, grief doth most
                                    lament.
Grief joys, joy grieves on slender
                                accident.
This world is not for aye, nor
                                    ’tis not strange

That even our loves should with our
                                    fortunes change.
For ’tis a question left us yet
                                    to prove,
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune
                                    love.
The great man down, you mark his favorite
                                    flies.
The poor advanced makes friends of
                                enemies.
And hitherto doth love on fortune
                                tend,
For who not needs shall never lack a
                                friend,
And who in want a hollow friend doth
                                try,
Directly seasons him his enemy.
But, orderly to end where I begun,
Our wills and fates do so contrary
                                run

That our devices still are
                                overthrown.
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of
                                    our own.
So think thou wilt no second husband
                                wed,
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is
                                    dead.#LBSFORGOLD
Someone might marry a second time for
                                    money, but never for love. Any time I kissed my second husband
                                    in bed, I’d kill the first one all over
                                again.
I know that’s what you think
                                    now, but people change their minds. Often our intentions are
                                    strong at first, but as time goes on they weaken, just like an
                                    apple sticks to the tree when it is unripe but falls to the
                                    ground once it ripens. The promises we make to ourselves in
                                    emotional moments lose their power once the emotion passes.
                                    Great grief and joy may rouse us to action, but when the grief
                                    or joy have passed, we’re no longer motivated to act.
                                    Joy turns to grief in the blink of an eye, and grief becomes joy
                                    just as quickly. This world is not made for either one to last
                                    long in, and it’s no surprise that even our loves
                                    change along with our luck. It’s still a mystery to
                                    be solved whether luck controls love, or love controls luck.
                                    When a great man has a run of bad luck, watch how followers
                                    desert him, and when a poor man advances to an important
                                    position, he makes friends with the people he used to hate. Love
                                    is unreliable. A person with lots of money will always have
                                    friends, while one fallen on hard times makes an enemy of any
                                    friend he turns to for money. But back to my original
                                    point—what we want and what we get are always at
                                    odds. We can have our little dreams, but the fates decide our
                                    futures. You think now you’ll never remarry, but that
                                    thought will die with me, your first husband.
