Thus much the business is: we have here writTo Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras—Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hearsOf this his nephew’s purpose—to suppressHis further gait herein, in that the levies,The lists, and full proportions are all madeOut of his subject; and we here dispatchYou, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,Giving to you no further personal powerTo business with the king more than the scopeOf these dilated articles allow.
                                (gives
                                    them a paper)
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.In that and all things will we show our duty.We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?You told us of some suit. What is ’t, Laertes?You cannot speak of reason to the DaneAnd lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?The head is not more native to the heart,The hand more instrumental to the mouth,Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.What wouldst thou have, Laertes?    My dread lord,Your leave and favor to return to France,From whence though willingly I came to DenmarkTo show my duty in your coronation,Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,My thoughts and wishes bend again toward FranceAnd bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.#LBSFORGOLDI’ve written to Fortinbras’s uncle, the
                                present head of Norway, an old bedridden man who knows next to
                                nothing about his nephew’s plans. I’ve told
                                the uncle to stop those plans, which he has the power to do, since
                                all the troops assembled by young Fortinbras are Norwegian, and thus
                                under the uncle’s control. I’m giving the job
                                of delivering this letter to you, good Cornelius, and you,
                                Voltemand. Your business in Norway will be limited to this task.
                                (he gives them a paper) Now good-bye.
                                Show your loyalty by leaving quickly, rather than with elaborate
                                speeches.We’ll do our duty to you in that and everything
                            else.I have no doubt you will. Good-bye.And now, Laertes, what do you have to tell me? You have a favor
                                you to ask of me. What is it, Laertes? You’ll never waste
                                your words when talking to the king of Denmark. What could you ever
                                ask for that I wouldn’t give you? Your father and the
                                Danish throne are as close as the mind and the heart, or the hand
                                and the mouth. What would you like, Laertes?My lord, I want your permission to go back to France, which I left
                                to come to Denmark for your coronation. I confess, my thoughts are
                                on France, now that my duty is done. Please, let me go.
