So much for this, sir. Now shall you see the other.You do remember all the circumstance?Remember it, my lord?Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fightingThat would not let me sleep. Methought I layWorse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly—And praised be rashness for it: let us knowOur indiscretion sometimes serves us wellWhen our deep plots do pall, and that should teach usThere’s a divinity that shapes our ends,Rough-hew them how we will—That is most certain.Up from my cabin,My sea-gown scarfed about me, in the darkGroped I to find out them, had my desire,Fingered their packet, and in fine withdrewTo mine own room again, making so bold(My fears forgetting manners) to unsealTheir grand commission, where I found, Horatio—O royal knavery!—an exact command,Larded with many several sorts of reasonsImporting Denmark’s health, and England’s
                                too,With—ho!—such bugs and goblins in my lifeThat, on the supervise (no leisure bated,No, not to stay the grinding of the ax)My head should be struck off.#LBSFORGOLDThat’s enough about that. Now I’ll tell you
                                the other story about my journey. Do you remember the
                            circumstances?How could I forget, my lord!There was a kind of war in my brain that wouldn’t let
                                me sleep. It was worse than being a captive in chains. Sometimes
                                it’s good to be rash—sometimes it works out
                                well to act impulsively when our careful plans lose steam. This
                                should show us that there’s a God in heaven
                                who’s always guiding us in the right direction, however
                                often we screw up—Well, of course.So I came up from my cabin with my robe tied around me, groped in
                                the dark to find what I was looking for, found it, looked through
                                their packet of papers, and returned to my cabin again. I was bold
                                enough (I guess my fears made me forget my manners) to open the
                                document containing the king’s instructions. And there I
                                found, Horatio, such royal mischief—a precisely worded
                                order, sugared with lots of talk about Denmark’s
                                well-being and England’s too, to cut off my head, without
                                even waiting to sharpen the ax.
