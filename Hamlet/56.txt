And there assume some other horrible form,Which might deprive your sovereignty of reasonAnd draw you into madness? Think of it.The very place puts toys of desperation,Without more motive, into every brainThat looks so many fathoms to the seaAnd hears it roar beneath.It waves me still.—Go on. I’ll follow thee.You shall not go, my lord.    Hold off your
                                hands.Be ruled. You shall not go.    My fate cries outAnd makes each petty artery in this bodyAs hardy as the Nemean lion’s nerve.Still am I called.—Unhand me, gentlemen.
(draws his sword)
By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me.I say, away!—Go on. I’ll follow thee.He waxes desperate with imagination.Let’s follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey
                            him.Have after. To what issue will this come?#LBSFORGOLDwhere it takes on some other horrible form that drives you insane.
                                Think about it. The edge of the sea makes people feel despair even
                                at the best of times. All they have to do is look into its depths
                                and hear it roar far below.It’s still waving to me. —Go ahead,
                                I’ll follow.You’re not going, sir.Let go of me.Calm down. You’re not going anywhere.It’s my fate calling me. Every nerve in my body is now
                                as tough as steel. The ghost is still waving me over. Let me go,
                                gentlemen. (he draws his sword)
I swear, if anyone holds me back, I’ll make a ghost of
                                him! I say, get away!—Go ahead, I’ll follow
                                you.His imagination is making him crazy.Let’s follow them. It’s not right to obey
                                his orders to let him go alone.Go ahead and follow him. But what does all this mean, where will
                                it all end?
