To take him in the purging of his soulWhen he is fit and seasoned for his passage?No.Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed,At game a-swearing, or about some actThat has no relish of salvation in ’t—Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,And that his soul may be as damned and blackAs hell, whereto it goes. My mother staysThis physic but prolongs thy sickly days.

                                thoughts remain below.Words without thoughts never to heaven go.#LBSFORGOLDSo is it really revenge for me if I kill Claudius right when he is
                                confessing his sins, in perfect condition for a trip to heaven? No.
                                Away, sword, and wait for a better moment to kill him.
                                (he puts his sword away) When
                                he’s sleeping off some drunken orgy, or having incestuous
                                sex, or swearing while he gambles, or committing some other act that
                                has no goodness about it—that’s when
                                I’ll trip him up and send him to hell with his heels
                                kicking up at heaven. My mother’s waiting. The
                                king’s trying to cure himself with prayer, but all
                                he’s doing is keeping himself alive a little
                            longer.
(rising) My words fly up toward
                                heaven, but my thoughts stay down here on earth. Words without
                                thoughts behind them will never make it to heaven.
