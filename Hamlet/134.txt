And can you by no drift of conferenceGet from him why he puts on this confusion,Grating so harshly all his days of quietWith turbulent and dangerous lunacy?He does confess he feels himself distracted.But from what cause he will by no means speak.Nor do we find him forward to be sounded.But with a crafty madness keeps aloofWhen we would bring him on to some confessionOf his true state.  Did he receive you well?Most like a gentleman.But with much forcing of his disposition.Niggard of question, but of our demandsMost free in his reply.    Did you assay him?To any pastime?Madam, it so fell out, that certain playersWe o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,And there did seem in him a kind of joy#LBSFORGOLDAnd you can’t put your heads together and figure out
                                why he’s acting so dazed and confused, ruining his peace
                                and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy?He admits he feels confused, but refuses to say why.And he’s not exactly eager to be interrogated.
                                He’s very sly and dances around our questions when we try
                                to get him to talk about how he feels.Did he treat you well when you saw him?Yes, in a very gentlemanly way.But it seemed like he had to force himself to be nice to
                            us.He didn’t ask questions, but answered ours at
                            length.Did you try tempting him with some entertainment?Madam, some actors happened to cross our paths on the way here. We
                                told Hamlet about them, and that seemed to do him good.
