                                our last night’s speech.We’ll put the matter to the present push.—Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.—This grave shall have a living monument.An hour of quiet shortly shall we see.Till then in patience our proceeding be.#LBSFORGOLDListen, sir, why do you treat me like this? I always loved you.
                                But it doesn’t matter. Even a hero like Hercules
                                can’t keep cats from acting like cats, and dogs like
                                dogs.Please, Horatio, go with him.

                                last forever, I promise. We’ll have the quiet we need
                                soon. In the meantime, let’s proceed patiently.
