Ophelia, walk you here. (to
                                CLAUDIUS) Gracious, so please you,We will bestow ourselves. (to
                                OPHELIA)Read on this bookThat show of such an exercise may colorYour loneliness.—We are oft to blame in this,'Tis too much proved, that with devotion’s
                                visageAnd pious action we do sugar o'erThe devil himself.
(aside) Oh,
                                ’tis too true!How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!The harlot’s cheek, beautied with plastering art,Is not more ugly to the thing that helps itThan is my deed to my most painted word.O heavy burden!I hear him coming. Let’s withdraw, my lord.To be, or not to be? That is the question—Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to sufferThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,And, by opposing, end them? To die, to sleep—No more—and by a sleep to say we endThe heartache and the thousand natural shocksThat flesh is heir to—’tis a consummationDevoutly to be wished! To die, to sleep.To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the
                                rub,For in that sleep of death what dreams may comeWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,Must give us pause. There’s the respectThat makes calamity of so long life.#LBSFORGOLDOphelia, come here.—(to
                                CLAUDIUS) Your Majesty, we will hide.
                                (to
                                OPHELIA)—Read from this
                                prayer book, so it looks natural that you’re all alone.
                                Come to think of it, this happens all the time—people act
                                devoted to God to mask their bad deeds.
(to himself) How right he is! His
                                words whip up my guilty feelings. The whore’s pockmarked
                                cheek made pretty with make-up is just like the ugly actions
                                I’m disguising with fine words. What a terrible guilt I
                                feel!I hear him coming. Quick, let’s hide, my lord.The question is: is it better to be alive or dead? Is it nobler to
                                put up with all the nasty things that luck throws your way, or to
                                fight against all those troubles by simply putting an end to them
                                once and for all? Dying, sleeping—that’s all
                                dying is—a sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks
                                that life on earth gives us—that’s an
                                achievement to wish for. To die, to sleep—to sleep, maybe
                                to dream. Ah, but there’s the catch: in
                                death’s sleep who knows what kind of dreams might come,
                                after we’ve put the noise and commotion of life behind
                                us. That’s certainly something to worry about.
                                That’s the consideration that makes us stretch out our
                                sufferings so long.
