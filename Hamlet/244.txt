Where is this king?—Sirs, stand you all without.No, let’s come in!I pray you, give me leave.We will, we will.I thank you. Keep the door.—O thou vile king,Give me my father!  Calmly, good Laertes.That drop of blood that’s calm proclaims me bastard,Cries “Cuckold!” to my father, brands the
                                “harlot”Even here between the chaste unsmirchèd browOf my true mother.  What is the cause, Laertes,That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?—Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.There’s such divinity doth hedge a kingThat treason can but peep to what it would,Acts little of his will.—Tell me, Laertes,Why thou art thus incensed.—Let him go,
                                Gertrude.—Speak, man. Where is my father?    Dead.But not by him.  Let him demand his fill.#LBSFORGOLDWhere’s this so-called king? Men, wait outside.No, let us in!Please wait.All right, we will, we will.Thank you. Guard the door. (to
                                CLAUDIUS) Oh, you vile king, give me my father!Calm down, good Laertes.I’ve got exactly one calm drop of blood in my body, and
                                it proclaims that I’m a bastardLaertes suggests that since he hasn’t yet punished his father’s murderer, he must not be his real son.I’m a bastard, says my father was
                                betrayed, and stamps the label “whore” on the
                                pure forehead of my devoted mother.Laertes, what makes you so rebellious? Let him go, Gertrude.
                                Don’t worry about my getting hurt. God protects the king,
                                so traitors can’t hurt him.—Tell me, Laertes,
                                why you’re so angry.—Gertrude, let him
                                go.—Tell me, man.Where’s my father?He’s dead.But the king didn’t kill him.Let him ask what he wants to ask.
