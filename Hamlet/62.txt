Now, Hamlet, hear.'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of DenmarkIs by a forgèd process of my deathRankly abused. But know, thou noble youth,The serpent that did sting thy father’s lifeNow wears his crown.O my prophetic soul! My uncle?#LBSFORGOLDmake your eyes jump out of their sockets, and your hair stand on

                                faster than a person falls in love.I’m glad you’re eager. You’d have
