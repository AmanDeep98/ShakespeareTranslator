  Here, sweet lord, at your service.Horatio, thou art e'en as just a manAs e'er my conversation coped withal.O my dear lord—  Nay, do not think I flatter.For what advancement may I hope from theeThat no revenue hast but thy good spirits,To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flattered?No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,And crook the pregnant hinges of the kneeWhere thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?Since my dear soul was mistress of her choiceAnd could of men distinguish, her electionHath sealed thee for herself, for thou hast been—As one in suffering all that suffers nothing—A man that Fortune’s buffets and rewardsHast ta'en with equal thanks. And blessed are thoseWhose blood and judgment are so well commingled,That they are not a pipe for Fortune’s fingerTo sound what stop she please. Give me that manThat is not passion’s slave, and I will wear himIn my heart’s core, ay, in my heart of heart,As I do thee.—Something too much of this.—There is a play tonight before the king.One scene of it comes near the circumstanceWhich I have told thee of my father’s death.I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,Even with the very comment of thy soulObserve mine uncle. If his occulted guiltDo not itself unkennel in one speech,It is a damnèd ghost that we have seen,And my imaginations are as foul#LBSFORGOLDHere I am at your service, my dear lord.Horatio, you’re the best man I’ve ever
                                known.Oh, sir—Don’t think I’m flattering you. What could I
                                hope to get from you, who’ve got nothing but your charm
                                to support you in life? Why would anyone flatter a poor person? No,
                                keep flattery for kissing the hands of those who can pay well. You
                                understand? Ever since I’ve been a free agent in my
                                choice of friends, I’ve chosen you because you take
                                everything life hands you with calm acceptance, grateful for both
                                good and bad. Blessed are those who mix emotion with reason in just
                                the right proportion, making them strong enough to resist the whims
                                of Lady Luck. Show me the person who’s master of his
                                emotions, and I’ll put him close to my
                                heart—in my heart of hearts—as I do you. But
                                I’m talking too much. The point is, there’s a
                                play being performed for the king tonight. One of the scenes comes
                                very close to depicting the circumstances of my father’s
                                death, as I described them to you. Watch my uncle carefully when
                                that scene begins. If his guilty secret does not reveal itself, then
                                that ghost was just a devil, and my hunch wasn’t, in
                                fact, worth anything.
