The air bites shrewdly. It is very cold.It is a nipping and an eager air.What hour now?I think it lacks of twelve.No, it is struck.Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the seasonWherein the spirit held his wont to walk.What does this mean, my lord?The king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse,Keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels,And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray outThe triumph of his pledge.Is it a custom?Ay, marry, is ’t.But to my mind, though I am native hereAnd to the manner born, it is a customMore honored in the breach than the observance.This heavy-headed revel east and westMakes us traduced and taxed of other nations.#LBSFORGOLDThe air is biting cold.Yes, it’s definitely nippy.What time is it?A little before twelve, I think.No, it’s just after twelve; I heard the clock
                            strike.Really? I didn’t hear it. So it’s nearly the
                                time when the ghost likes to appear.What does that mean, sir?The king is staying up all night drinking and dancing. As he
                                guzzles down his German wine, the musicians make a ruckus to
                                celebrate his draining another cup.Is that a tradition?Yes, it is. But though I was born here and should consider that
                                tradition part of my own heritage, I think it would be better to
                                ignore it than practice it. Other countries criticize us for our
                                loud partying.
