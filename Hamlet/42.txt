It fits your wisdom so far to believe itAs he in his particular act and placeMay give his saying deed, which is no furtherThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal.Then weigh what loss your honor may sustainIf with too credent ear you list his songs,Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure openTo his unmastered importunity.Fear it, Ophelia. Fear it, my dear sister,And keep you in the rear of your affection,Out of the shot and danger of desire.The chariest maid is prodigal enoughIf she unmask her beauty to the moon.Virtue itself ’scapes not calumnious strokes.The canker galls the infants of the springToo oft before their buttons be disclosed.And in the morn and liquid dew of youth,Contagious blastments are most imminent.Be wary, then. Best safety lies in fear.Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.I shall the effect of this good lesson keepAs watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,Show me the steep and thorny way to heavenWhiles, like a puffed and reckless libertine,Himself the primrose path of dalliance treadsAnd recks not his own rede.    O, fear me
                            not.I stay too long. But here my father comes.A double blessing is a double grace.Occasion smiles upon a second leave.#LBSFORGOLDSo if he says he loves you, you should be wise enough to see that
                                his words only mean as much as the state of Denmark allows them to
                                mean. Then think about how shameful it would be for you to give in
                                to his seductive talk and surrender your treasure chest to his
                                greedy hands. Watch out, Ophelia. Just keep your love under control,
                                and don’t let yourself become a target of his lust.
                                Simply exposing your beauty to the moon at night is risky
                                enough—you don’t have to expose yourself to
                                him. Even good girls sometimes get a bad reputation. Worms ruin
                                flowers before they blossom. Baby blooms are most susceptible to
                                disease. So be careful. Fear will keep you safe. Young people often
                                lose their self-control even without any help from others.I’ll keep your words of wisdom close to my heart. But,
                                my dear brother, don’t be like a bad priest who fails to
                                practice what he preaches, showing me the steep and narrow way to
                                heaven while you frolic on the primrose path of sin.Don’t worry, I won’t.I’ve been here too long. And here comes father. What
                                good luck, to have him bless my leaving not once but twice.
