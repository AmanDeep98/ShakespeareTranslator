I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this
                            pipe?My lord, I cannot.I pray you.Believe me, I cannot.I do beseech you.I know no touch of it, my lord.It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your 
fingers and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it
will discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the
stops.
But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony.I have not the skill.Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You would play upon me. You would seem to know my
stops. You would pluck out the heart of my mystery. You
would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my
compass. And there is much music, excellent voice, in this 
little organ, yet cannot you make it speak? 'Sblood, do
                                you
think I am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you
cannot play upon me.
#LBSFORGOLDI don’t really understand what you mean. Will you play
                                this recorder?I can’t, my lord.Please.I’m serious, I can’t.I’m begging you.I have no idea how.Oh, it’s as easy as lying. Just put your fingers and
                                thumb over the holes and blow into it, and it’ll produce
                                the most moving music. Here, the holes are here.But I can’t play a melody. I don’t know
                            how.Well, look how you play me—as if you knew exactly where
                                to put your fingers, to blow the mystery out of me, playing all the
                                octaves of my range—and yet you can’t even
                                produce music from this little instrument? My God, do you think
                                I’m easier to manipulate than a pipe? You can push my
                                buttons, but you can’t play me for a fool.
