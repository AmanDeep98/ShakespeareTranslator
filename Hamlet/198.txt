Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell.I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.Thou find’st to be too busy is some danger.
(to
                                GERTRUDE) Leave wringing of your
                                hands. Peace. Sit you downAnd let me wring your heart. For so I shallIf it be made of penetrable stuff,If damnèd custom have not brassed it soThat it is proof and bulwark against sense.What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongueIn noise so rude against me?    Such an actThat blurs the grace and blush of modesty,Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the roseFrom the fair forehead of an innocent loveAnd sets a blister there, makes marriage vowsAs false as dicers' oaths—oh, such a deedAs from the body of contraction plucksThe very soul, and sweet religion makesA rhapsody of words. Heaven’s face doth glowO'er this solidity and compound massWith tristful visage, as against the doom,Is thought-sick at the act.    Ay me, what actThat roars so loud and thunders in the index?Look here upon this picture and on this,The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.See, what a grace was seated on this brow?Hyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself,An eye like Mars to threaten and command,A station like the herald MercuryNew-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill—A combination and a form indeedWhere every god did seem to set his seal#LBSFORGOLDYou low-life, nosy, busybody fool, goodbye. I thought you were
                                somebody more important. You’ve gotten what you deserve.
                                I guess you found out it’s dangerous to be a busybody.

                                GERTRUDE) Stop wringing your hands.
                                Sit down and let me wring your heart instead, which I will do if
                                it’s still soft enough, if your evil lifestyle has not
                                toughened it against feeling anything at all.What have I done that you dare to talk to me so rudely?A deed that destroys modesty, turns virtue into hypocrisy,
                                replaces the blossom on the face of true love with a nasty blemish,
                                makes marriage vows as false as a gambler’s
                                oath—oh, you’ve done a deed that plucks the
                                soul out of marriage and turns religion into meaningless blather.
                                Heaven looks down on this earth, as angry as if Judgment Day were
                                here, and is sick at the thought of what you’ve
                            done.C’mon, what’s this deed that sounds so awful
                                even before I know what it is?Look at this picture here, and that one there, the painted images of two brothersHamlet may be referring to miniatures they wear around their necks, or to pictures on the wall.the painted images
                                    of two brothers. Look how kind and gentlemanly this one is, with his
                                curly hair and his forehead like a Greek god. His eye could command
                                like the god of war. His body is as agile as Mercury just landing on
                                a high hill.A figure and a combination of good qualities that seemed like
                                every god had set his stamp on this man.
