    Alack, what noise
                                is this?Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.What is the matter?  Save yourself, my lord.The ocean, overpeering of his list,Eats not the flats with more impiteous hasteThan young Laertes, in a riotous head,O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him
                                “lord”And—as the world were now but to begin,Antiquity forgot, custom not known,The ratifiers and props of every word—They cry, “Choose we! Laertes shall be
                                king!”Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds:“Laertes shall be king, Laertes
                            king!”How cheerfully on the false trail they cry.O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!The doors are broke.#LBSFORGOLDOh, no—what’s that noise?Listen! Where are my bodyguards? Let them guard the door.What is it?You must save yourself, my lord. The young Laertes, like the ocean
                                when it floods the shore and devours the lowlands, is leading a
                                rebellion against your government. The crowd calls him
                                “lord” and shouts, “We want Laertes
                                to be king!” It’s as if they were starting the
                                world from scratch right now, throwing out the traditions and
                                ancient customs that are the support of every word we utter. They
                                throw their caps in the air and yell, “Laertes will be
                                king! Laertes king!”They sound so cheerful as they hunt down the wrong prey! Oh,
                                you’re on the wrong track, you disloyal Danish
                            dogs!The doors have been smashed open.
