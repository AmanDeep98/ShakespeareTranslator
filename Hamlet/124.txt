And, like a neutral to his will and
                                matter,
Did nothing.
But as we often see against some
                                storm

A silence in the heavens, the rack stand
                                    still,
The bold winds speechless, and the orb
                                below

As hush as death, anon the dreadful
                                thunder

Doth rend the region. So, after
                                    Pyrrhus' pause,
Arousèd vengeance sets him new
                                    a-work.
And never did the Cyclops' hammers
                                    fall

On Mars’s armor forged for proof
                                    eterne

With less remorse than Pyrrhus'
                                    bleeding sword

Now falls on Priam.
Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you
                                gods

In general synod take away her
                                power,
Break all the spokes and fellies from her
                                    wheel,
And bowl the round nave down the hill of
                                    heaven,
As low as to the fiends!
This is too long.It shall to the barber’s, with your
                                beard.—Prithee, say on.
He’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say
                                on. Come
to Hecuba.

But who, ah woe, who had seen the
                                    moblèd queen—“The moblèd queen”?#LBSFORGOLD
But the wind created by his sword is enough
                                    to make

The weakened old man fall. Just then the
                                    city of Ilium,
As if feeling this fatal blow to its
                                ruler,
Collapses in flames, and the crash

Captures Pyrrhus’s attention.
                                    His sword,
Which was falling onto Priam’s
                                    white-haired head

Seemed to hang in the air.
Pyrrhus stood there like a man in a
                                    painting,
Doing nothing.
But just as a raging thunderstorm

Is often interrupted by a
                                    moment’s silence,
And then soon after the region is split
                                    apart by dreadful thunderclaps,
In the same way, after Pyrrhus
                                paused,
His newly awakened fury set him to work
                                    again.
When the Cyclopses were making unbreakable
                                    armor

For the god of war, their hammers never
                                fell

So mercilessly as Pyrrhus’s bloody
                                    sword

Now falls on Priam.
Get out of here, Lady Luck, you whore! All
                                    you gods

Should come together to rob her of her
                                    powers,
Break all the spokes on her wheel of
                                    fortune,
And send it rolling down the hills of
                                heaven

Into the depths of hell.This speech is going on too long.We’ll have the barber trim it later, along with your
                                beard. Please, continue, players. This old man only likes the
                                dancing or the sex scenes; he sleeps through all the rest. Go on,
                                come to the part about Hecuba.
But who—ah, the
                                    sadness—had seen the muffled
                                queen—
“The muffled queen”?
