To hear of it. They are about the court,And, as I think, they have already orderThis night to play before him.    'Tis
                                most true,And he beseeched me to entreat your MajestiesTo hear and see the matter.With all my heart, and it doth much content meTo hear him so inclined.Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,And drive his purpose on to these delights.We shall, my lord.Sweet Gertrude, leave us too,For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,That he, as ’twere by accident, may hereAffront Ophelia.Her father and myself (lawful espials)Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,We may of their encounter frankly judge,And gather by him, as he is behaved,If ’t be the affliction of his love or noThat thus he suffers for.    I shall obey you.And for your part, Ophelia, I do wishThat your good beauties be the happy causeOf Hamlet’s wildness. So shall I hope your virtuesWill bring him to his wonted way again,To both your honors.  Madam, I wish it may.#LBSFORGOLDThey are here at court now, and I believe they’ve been
                                told to give a performance for him tonight.It’s true, and he asked me to beg you both to
                            attend.It makes me very happy to hear he’s so interested.
                                Gentlemen, please try to sharpen his interest even more, and let
                                this play do him some good.We will, my lord.Dear Gertrude, please give us a moment alone. We’ve
                                secretly arranged for Hamlet to come here so that he can run into
                                Ophelia. Her father and I, justifiably acting as spies, will hide in
                                the room and observe Hamlet’s behavior, to determine
                                whether it’s love that’s making him
                            suffer.Yes, I’ll go. As for you, Ophelia, I hope that your
                                beauty is the reason for Hamlet’s insane behavior, just
                                as I hope your virtues will return him to normal some day, for the
                                good of both of you.I hope so too, Madam.
