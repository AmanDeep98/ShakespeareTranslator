Ay, sir, that soaks up the king’s countenance, his
                                rewards,
his authorities. But such officers do the king best service in
the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw,
 first mouthed to be last swallowed. When he needs what
you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you
shall be dry again.
I understand you not, my lord.I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us
to the king.
The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body.The king is a thing—A thing, my lord?Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide, fox, and all after.#LBSFORGOLDYes, sir, a sponge that soaks up the king’s approval,
                                his rewards, and his decisions. Officers like that give the king the
                                best service in the end. He keeps them in his mouth like an ape.

                                what you have found out, he can just squeeze you like a sponge and
                                you’ll be dry again.I don’t follow, my lord.I’m glad about that. Sly words are never understood by
                                fools.My lord, you have to tell us where the body is, and then go with
                                us to see the king.The body’s with the king, but the king’s not
                                with the body. The king’s a thing …A “thing,” my lord?A thing of no importance. Take me to him. Ready or not, here I
                                come!
