    He made confession
                                of you,And gave you such a masterly reportFor art and exercise in your defense,And for your rapier most especially,That he cried out ’twould be a sight indeedIf one could match you. The ’scrimers of their nation,He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,If you opposed them. Sir, this report of hisDid Hamlet so envenom with his envyThat he could nothing do but wish and begYour sudden coming o'er, to play with him.Now, out of this—  What out of this, my lord?Laertes, was your father dear to you?Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,A face without a heart?    Why ask you
                            this?Not that I think you did not love your fatherBut that I know love is begun by time,And that I see, in passages of proof,Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.There lives within the very flame of loveA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it.And nothing is at a like goodness still.For goodness, growing to a pleurisy,Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,We should do when we would, for this “would”
                                changesAnd hath abatements and delays as manyAs there are tongues, are hands, are accidents.And then this “should” is like a spendthrift
                                sighThat hurts by easing.—But to the quick of
                                th' ulcer:Hamlet comes back. What would you undertakeTo show yourself in deed your father’s sonMore than in words?#LBSFORGOLDHe mentioned you to me, giving you such high marks in fencing that
                                he exclaimed it would be a miracle if someone could match you.
                                French fencers wouldn’t be good enough for you, he said,
                                since they don’t have the right moves or skills. Hamlet
                                was so jealous when he heard Lamond’s report that he
                                talked about nothing else but having you come over and play against
                                him. Now, the point is …What’s the point, my lord?Laertes, did you love your father? Or is your grief just an
                                illusion—a mere painting of sorrow?How could you ask?Not that I suspect you didn’t love your father, but
                                I’ve seen it happen that, as the days go by, time dampens
                                the flame of love. The fire of love always burns itself out, and
                                nothing stays the way it began. Even a good thing can grow too big
                                and die from its own excess. We should do what we intend to do right
                                when we intend it, since our intentions are subject to as many
                                weakenings and delays as there are words in the dictionary and
                                accidents in life. And then all our “woulds”
                                and “shoulds” are nothing but hot air. But
                                back to my point:Hamlet’s coming back. What proof will you
                                offer—in action, not just words—that
                                you’re your father’s son?
