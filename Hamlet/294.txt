Sweets to the sweet. Farewell!

                                    flowers)
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife.I thought thy bride-bed to have decked, sweet maid,And not have strewed thy grave.    Oh, treble woeFall ten times treble on that cursèd head,Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious senseDeprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhileTill I have caught her once more in mine arms.Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,Till of this flat a mountain you have made,T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish headOf blue Olympus.

                                he whose griefBears such an emphasis, whose phrase of sorrowConjures the wandering stars, and makes them standLike wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,Hamlet the Dane.
                                (leaps into the
                                grave)
The devil take thy soul!Thou pray’st not well.I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat,For though I am not splenitive and rash,Yet have I something in me dangerous,Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand.Pluck them asunder.#LBSFORGOLDSweet flowers for a sweet girl. Goodbye!
                                (she scatters flowers) I once hoped
                                you’d be my Hamlet’s wife. I thought
                                I’d be tossing flowers on your wedding bed, my sweet
                                girl, not on your grave.Oh, damn three times, damn ten times the evil man whose wicked
                                deed deprived you of your ingenious mind. Hold off burying her until
                                I’ve caught her in my arms once more.Now pile the dirt onto the living and the dead alike, till
                                you’ve made a mountain higher thanMount Pelion or Mount OlympusIn Greek myth, Mt. Olympus is home to the gods, and giants piled Mt. Ossa on top of Mt. Pelion to climb to heaven.Mount Pelion or Mount Olympus.
(coming forward) Who is the one
                                whose grief is so loud and clear, whose words of sadness make the
                                planets stand still in the heavens as if they’ve been
                                hurt by what they’ve heard? It’s me, Hamlet
                                the Dane.
                                (he jumps into the
                            grave)
To hell with your soul!That’s no way to pray.
                                (they
                                    fight)
                                Please take your hands off my throat. I may not be rash and quick to
                                anger, but I have something dangerous in me which you should beware
                                of. Take your hands off.Pull them apart.
