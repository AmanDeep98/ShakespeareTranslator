    Sit down a whileAnd let us once again assail your ears,That are so fortified against our story,What we have two nights seen.    Well, sit we down,And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.Last night of all,When yond same star that’s westward from the poleHad made his course t' illume that part of heavenWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself,The bell then beating one—Peace, break thee off. Look where it comes again!In the same figure like the king that’s dead.

                                HORATIO) Thou art a scholar. Speak to
                                it, Horatio.Looks it not like the king? Mark it, Horatio.Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.It would be spoke to.  Question it, Horatio.What art thou that usurp’st this time of nightTogether with that fair and warlike formIn which the majesty of buried DenmarkDid sometimes march? By heaven, I charge thee, speak.#LBSFORGOLDSit down for a while, and we’ll tell you again the
                                story you don’t want to believe, about what
                                we’ve seen two nights now.Well, let’s sit down and listen to Barnardo tell
                            us.Last night, when that star to the west of the North Star had
                                traveled across the night sky to that point where it’s
                                shining now, at one o'clock, Marcellus and
                            I—Quiet, shut up! It’s come again.Looking just like the dead king.
(to
                                HORATIO) You’re
                                well-educated, Horatio. Say something to it.Doesn’t he look like the king, Horatio?Very much so. It’s terrifying.It wants us to speak to it.Ask it something, Horatio.What are you, that you walk out so late at night, looking like the
                                dead king of Denmark when he dressed for battle? By God, I order you
                                to speak.
