My lord, upon the platform where we watch.Did you not speak to it?    My lord, I did,But answer made it none. Yet once methoughtIt lifted up its head and did addressItself to motion, like as it would speak.But even then the morning cock crew loud,And at the sound it shrunk in haste awayAnd vanished from our sight.    'Tis
                                very strange.As I do live, my honored lord, ’tis true.And we did think it writ down in our dutyTo let you know of it.Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.Hold you the watch tonight?    We do, my
                            lord.Armed, say you?  Armed, my lord.      From
                                top to toe?My lord, from head to foot.    Then saw you not
                                his face?Oh yes, my lord. He wore his beaver up.#LBSFORGOLDOn the platform where we stand guard, sir.Didn’t you talk to it?I did, sir, but it didn’t answer me. It raised its head
                                once as if it was about to speak, but just then the rooster started
                                crowing, and the ghost vanished from sight.That’s very strange.I swear to God it’s true, sir. We thought you ought to
                                know about it.Yes, I should know, but it disturbs me. Are you on duty again
                                tonight?Yes, sir.It was armed, you say?Armed, sir.From head to toe?Yes, from top to bottom, sir.So you couldn’t see his face, then?Oh, yes, we could, sir. He had his helmet visor up.
