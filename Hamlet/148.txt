Let her be round with him,And I’ll be placed, so please you, in the earOf all their conference. If she find him not,To England send him or confine him whereYour wisdom best shall think.It shall be so.Madness in great ones must not unwatched go.#LBSFORGOLDWe heard everything.—My lord, do whatever you like, but
                                if you like this idea, let his mother the queen get him alone and
                                beg him to share his feelings with her. I’ll hide and
                                listen in. If she can’t find out what his secret is, then
                                send him off to England or wherever you think best.That’s how we’ll do it, then. When important
                                people start to show signs of insanity, you have to watch them
                                closely.
