Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts—O wicked wit and gifts, that have the powerSo to seduce!—won to his shameful lustThe will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.O Hamlet, what a falling off was there!From me, whose love was of that dignityThat it went hand in hand even with the vowI made to her in marriage, and to declineUpon a wretch whose natural gifts were poorTo those of mine.But virtue, as it never will be moved,Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,So lust, though to a radiant angel linked,Will sate itself in a celestial bedAnd prey on garbage.But soft! Methinks I scent the morning air.Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,My custom always of the afternoon,Upon my secure hour thy uncle stoleWith juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,And in the porches of my ears did pourThe leperous distilment, whose effectHolds such an enmity with blood of manThat swift as quicksilver it courses throughThe natural gates and alleys of the bodyAnd with a sudden vigor doth possetAnd curd, like eager droppings into milk,The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine.And a most instant tetter barked about,Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crustAll my smooth body.Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s handOf life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched,Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,#LBSFORGOLDYes, that incestuous, adulterous animal. With his clever words and
                                fancy gifts, he seduced my seemingly virtuous queen, persuading her
                                to give in to his lust. They were evil words and gifts to seduce her
                                like that! Oh, Hamlet, how far she fell! She went from me, who loved
                                her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage,
                                to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine. But just
                                as you can’t corrupt a truly virtuous person no matter
                                how you try, the opposite is also true: a lustful person like her
                                can satisfy herself in a heavenly union and then move on to garbage.
                                But hang on, I think I smell the morning air. So let me be brief
                                here. Your uncle snuck up to me while I was sleeping in the orchard,
                                as I always used to do in the afternoon, and poured a vial of
                                henbane poison into my ear—that poison that moves like
                                quicksilver through the veins and curdles the blood, which is just
                                what it did to me. I broke out in a scaly rash that covered my
                                smooth body with a revolting crust. And that’s how my
                                brother robbed me of my life, my crown, and my queen all at once. He
                                cut me off in the middle of a sinful life.
