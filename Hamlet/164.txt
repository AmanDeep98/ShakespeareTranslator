Full thirty times hath Phoebus'
                                    cart gone round

Neptune’s salt wash and
                                    Tellus' orbèd ground,
And thirty dozen moons with borrowed
                                sheen

About the world have times twelve thirties
                                    been,
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our
                                hands

Unite commutual in most sacred
                                bands.
So many journeys may the sun and moon

Make us again count o'er ere
                                    love be done.
But woe is me! You are so sick of
                                late,
So far from cheer and from your former
                                    state,
That I distrust you. Yet though I
                                distrust,
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing
                                must.
For women fear too much, even as they
                                love,
And women’s fear and love hold
                                    quantity,
In neither aught, or in extremity.
Now what my love is, proof hath made you
                                    know,
And as my love is sized, my fear is
                                so:
Where love is great, the littlest doubts
                                    are fear.
Where little fears grow great, great love
                                    grows there.
Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly
                                    too.
My operant powers their functions leave to
                                    do.
And thou shalt live in this fair world
                                    behind,
Honored, beloved, and haply one as
                                kind

For husband shalt thou—
    Oh, confound the rest!
Such love must needs be treason in my
                                    breast.
In second husband let me be
                                accursed!
None wed the second but who killed the
                                    first.

It’s been thirty years since we
                                    were married.
I hope we stay in love for thirty more
                                    years! But I’m sad. You’ve been so gloomy
                                    lately, so unlike your usual cheerful self, that I worry
                                    something is wrong. But don’t let this upset you,
                                    since women are too afraid in love—for them, love and
                                    fear go hand in hand. You know very well how much I love you,
                                    and my fear is just as deep. When someone’s love is
                                    great, the little worries become very big. So when you see
                                    someone who worries a lot about little things, you know
                                    they’re really in love.
My love, I will have to leave you soon. My
                                    body is growing weak, and I will leave you behind in this
                                    beautiful world, honored and much loved. Perhaps
                                    you’ll find another
                            husband—
Oh, damn everyone else! Remarrying would be
                                    treason to my heart. Curse me if I take a second husband. When a
                                    woman takes a second husband, it’s because
                                    she’s killed off the first.
(to himself) Harsh!
