How long is that since?Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the very
day that young Hamlet was born, he that is mad and sent
into England.
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?Why, because he was mad. He shall recover his wits there,
or, if he do not, it’s no great matter there.
Why?'Twill not be seen in him there. There the men are as
                                mad
as he.
How came he mad?Very strangely, they say.How “strangely”?Faith, e'en with losing his wits.Upon what ground?Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy, thirty years.
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?#LBSFORGOLDHow long ago was that?You don’t know that? Any fool could tell you, it was
                                the day that young Hamlet was born—the one who went crazy
                                and got sent off to England.Why was he sent to England?Because he was crazy. He’ll recover his sanity there.
                                Or if he doesn’t, it won’t matter in
                            England.Why not?Because nobody will notice he’s crazy. Everyone there
                                is as crazy as he is.How did he go crazy?In a strange way, they say.What do you mean, “in a strange way”?By losing his mind.On what grounds?Right here in Denmark. I’ve been the church warden here
                                for thirty years, since childhood.How long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to
                            rot?
