With drink, sir?No, my lord, with choler.Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this
to the doctor. For, for me to put him to his purgation would
perhaps plunge him into far more choler.
Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and start
not so wildly from my affair.
I am tame, sir. Pronounce.The queen your mother, in most great affliction of spirit,
hath sent me to you.
You are welcome.Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed. If
it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do
your mother’s commandment. If not, your pardon and my
return shall be the end of my business.
Sir, I cannot.What, my lord?Make you a wholesome answer. My wit’s diseased. But,
                                sir,
such answer as I can make, you shall command. Or, rather,
as you say, my mother. Therefore no more but to the matter.
My mother, you say—
Then thus she says: your behavior hath struck her into
amazement and admiration.
#LBSFORGOLDWhat, an upset stomach from too much booze?No, sir, he’s angry.You should be smart enough to tell this to a doctor, not me, since
                                if I treated him, he’d just get angrier.My lord, please try to stick to the subject at hand.I’ll be good, sir. Go ahead.The queen your mother is upset, and sent me to see you.It’s lovely to see you.No, my lord, your polite words are not to the point. If you could
                                please stop fooling around, I’ll tell you what your
                                mother wants. If not, I’ll leave you alone and
                                that’ll be the end of my business.Sir, I can’t.Can’t what, my lord?Stop fooling around. My mind is confused. But I’ll do
                                my best to give you a straight answer, as you wish—or
                                rather, as my mother wishes. Okay, to the point. My mother, you say
                                …?She says that your behavior has astonished her.
