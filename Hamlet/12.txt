And terms compulsatory, those foresaid landsSo by his father lost. And this, I take it,Is the main motive of our preparations,The source of this our watch, and the chief headOf this posthaste and rummage in the land.I think it be no other but e'en so.Well may it sort that this portentous figureComes armèd through our watch so like the kingThat was and is the question of these wars.A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.In the most high and palmy state of Rome,A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted deadDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streetsAs stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,Disasters in the sun, and the moist starUpon whose influence Neptune’s empire standsWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.And even the like precurse of feared events,As harbingers preceding still the fatesAnd prologue to the omen coming on,Have heaven and earth together demonstratedUnto our climatures and countrymen.But soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again.I’ll cross it though it blast me.—Stay,
                                illusion!If thou hast any sound or use of voice,Speak to me.#LBSFORGOLDAs far as I understand, that’s why we’re
                                posted here tonight and why there’s such a commotion in
                                Denmark lately.I think that’s exactly right—that explains
                                why the ghost of the late king would haunt us now, since he caused
                                these wars.The ghost is definitely something to worry about. In the high and
                                mighty Roman Empire, just before the emperor Julius Caesar was
                                assassinated, corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the
                                streets of Rome speaking gibberish. There were shooting stars, and
                                blood mixed in with the morning dew, and threatening signs on the
                                face of the sun. The moon, which controls the tides of the sea, was
                                so eclipsed it almost went completely out. And we’ve had
                                similar omens of terrible things to come, as if heaven and earth
                                have joined together to warn us what’s going to
                            happen.Wait, look! It has come again. I’ll meet it if
                                it’s the last thing I do. —Stay here, you
                                hallucination!If you have a voice or can make sounds, speak to me.
