If it assume my noble father’s person,I’ll speak to it, though Hell itself should gapeAnd bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,If you have hitherto concealed this sight,Let it be tenable in your silence still.And whatsoever else shall hap tonight,Give it an understanding, but no tongue.I will requite your loves. So fare you well.Upon the platform, ’twixt eleven and twelve,I’ll visit you.  Our duty to your honor.Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.My father’s spirit in arms. All is not well.I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to
                                men’s eyes.#LBSFORGOLDIf it looks like my good father, I’ll speak to it, even
                                if Hell itself opens up and tells me to be quiet. I ask you, if
                                you’ve kept this a secret, keep doing so. Whatever
                                happens tonight, don’t talk about it. I’ll
                                return the favor. So good-bye for now. I’ll see you on
                                the guards' platform between eleven and twelve
                            tonight.We’ll do our duty to you, sir.Give me your love instead, as I give you mine. Good-bye.My father’s ghost—armed!
                                Something’s wrong. I suspect some foul play. I wish the
                                night were here already! Until then, I have to remain calm. Bad
                                deeds will be revealed, no matter how people try to hide
                            them.
