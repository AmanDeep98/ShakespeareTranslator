Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeedThe very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peakLike John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,And can say nothing—no, not for a king,Upon whose property and most dear lifeA damned defeat was made. Am I a coward?Who calls me “villain”? Breaks my pate
                                across?Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?Tweaks me by the nose? Gives me the lie i'

Who does me this?Ha!'Swounds, I should take it, for it cannot beBut I am pigeon-livered and lack gallTo make oppression bitter, or ere thisI should have fatted all the region kitesWith this slave’s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!O vengeance!Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,That I, the son of a dear father murdered,Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with wordsAnd fall a-cursing like a very drab,A scullion! Fie upon ’t, foh!About, my brain.—Hum, I have heardThat guilty creatures sitting at a playHave, by the very cunning of the scene,Been struck so to the soul that presentlyThey have proclaimed their malefactions.For murder, though it have no tongue, will speakWith most miraculous organ. I’ll have these playersPlay something like the murder of my fatherBefore mine uncle. I’ll observe his looks.I’ll tent him to the quick. If he do blench,I know my course. The spirit that I have seen#LBSFORGOLDWhat is Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, that he would weep for
                                her? Just imagine what he would do if he had the cause for feeling
                                that I do. He would drown the stage with his tears and burst the
                                audience’s ears with his terrible words, drive the guilty
                                spectators crazy, terrify the innocent ones, confuse the ignorant
                                ones, and astound absolutely everyone’s eyes and ears.
                                But what do I, a grim and uncourageous rascal, do? Mope around like
                                a dreamer, not even bothering with plans for revenge, and I can say
                                nothing—nothing at all—on behalf of a king
                                whose dear life was stolen. Am I a coward? Is there anyone out there
                                who’ll call me “villain” and slap
                                me hard? Pull off my beard? Pinch my nose? Call me the worst liar?
                                By God, if someone would do that to me, I’d take it,
                                because I’m a lily-livered man—otherwise, I
                                would’ve fattened up the local vultures with the
                                intestines of that low-life king a long time ago. Bloody, inhuman
                                villain! Remorseless, treacherous, sex-obsessed, unnatural villain!
                                Ah, revenge! What an ass I am. I’m so damn brave. My dear
                                father’s been murdered, and I’ve been urged to
                                seek revenge by heaven and hell, and yet all I can do is stand
                                around cursing like a whore in the streets. Damn it! I need to get
                                myself together here! Hmm…. I’ve heard that
                                guilty people watching a play have been so affected by the artistry
                                of the scene that they are driven to confess their crimes out
                            loud.
