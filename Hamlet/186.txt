I like him not, nor stands it safe with usTo let his madness range. Therefore prepare you.I your commission will forthwith dispatch,And he to England shall along with you.The terms of our estate may not endureHazard so dangerous as doth hourly growOut of his lunacies.  We will ourselves provide.Most holy and religious fear it isTo keep those many, many bodies safeThat live and feed upon your majesty.The single and peculiar life is boundWith all the strength and armor of the mindTo keep itself from noyance, but much moreThat spirit upon whose weal depend and restThe lives of many. The cease of majestyDies not alone, but, like a gulf, doth drawWhat’s near it with it. It is a massy wheelFixed on the summit of the highest mount,To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser thingsAre mortised and adjoined, which, when it falls,Each small annexment, petty consequence,Attends the boisterous ruin. Never aloneDid the king sigh, but with a general groan.Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage.For we will fetters put upon this fear,Which now goes too free-footed.#LBSFORGOLDI don’t like the way he’s acting, and
                                it’s not safe for me to let his insanity get out of
                                control. So get prepared. I’m sending you to England on
                                diplomatic business, and Hamlet will go with you. As king, I cannot
                                risk the danger he represents as he grows crazier by the
                            hour.We’ll take care of it. It’s a sacred duty to
                                protect the lives of all those who depend on Your Highness.Everyone tries to avoid harm, but the public figure demands even
                                more protection. When a great leader dies he doesn’t die
                                alone but, like a whirlpool, draws others with him. He’s
                                like a huge wheel on the top of the highest mountain whose spokes
                                touch the rim of ten thousand smaller things—when it
                                falls down the mountain, every little object goes down with it.
                                Whenever a king sighs, everyone groans.Prepare yourself, please, for this trip. We’ll put a
                                leash on this danger that’s now running wild.
