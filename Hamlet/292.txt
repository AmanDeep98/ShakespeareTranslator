    What ceremony
                                else?That is Laertes, a very noble youth, mark.What ceremony else?Her obsequies have been as far enlargedAs we have warranty. Her death was doubtful,And, but that great command o'ersways the order,She should in ground unsanctified have lodgedTill the last trumpet. For charitable prayersShards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her.Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants,Her maiden strewments, and the bringing homeOf bell and burial.Must there no more be done?No more be done.We should profane the service of the deadTo sing a requiem and such rest to herAs to peace-parted souls.    Lay her
                                i' th' earth,And from her fair and unpolluted fleshMay violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,A ministering angel shall my sister beWhen thou liest howling.

                            Ophelia?#LBSFORGOLDWhat other rites are you going to give her?That’s Laertes, a very noble young man. Listen.What other rites are you going to give her?I’ve performed as many rites as I’m
                                permitted. Her death was suspicious, and were it not for the fact
                                that the king gave orders to bury her here, she’d have
                                been buried outside the church graveyard. She deserves to have rocks
                                and stones thrown on her body. But she has had prayers read for her
                                and is dressed up like a pure virgin, with flowers tossed on her
                                grave and the bell tolling for her.Isn’t there any other rite you can perform?No, nothing. We would profane the other dead souls here if we sang
                                the same requiem for her that we sang for them.Lay her in the ground, and let violets bloom from her lovely and
                                pure flesh!I’m telling you, you jerk priest, my sister will be an
                                angel in heaven while you’re howling in hell.
