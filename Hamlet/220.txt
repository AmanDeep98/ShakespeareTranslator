I have sent to seek him and to find the body.How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!Yet must not we put the strong law on him.He’s loved of the distracted multitude,Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes.And where ’tis so, th' offender’s
                                scourge is weighed,But never the offense. To bear all smooth and even,This sudden sending him away must seemDeliberate pause. Diseases desperate grownBy desperate appliance are relieved,Or not at all. How now, what hath befall'n?Where the dead body is bestowed, my lord,We cannot get from him.But where is he?Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.Bring him before us.Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.Now, Hamlet, where’s Polonius?#LBSFORGOLDI’ve sent men to find him and retrieve the body. How
                                dangerous to have this madman on the loose! But we can’t
                                throw him in jail. The people love him, because they judge based on
                                appearance rather than reason. They’ll pay attention to
                                the severity of the punishment, not the severity of the crime. No,
                                we must seem calm and fair-minded, and our sending him away must
                                seem like a carefully considered move. But a terminal disease
                                requires extreme treatment, or nothing at all.So what’s happened?We can’t get him to tell us where he’s put
                                the body.But where is he?Outside, my lord, under guard, waiting for your orders.Bring him to me.Hey, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.Now, Hamlet, where’s Polonius?
