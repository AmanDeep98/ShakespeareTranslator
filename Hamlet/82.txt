And let him ply his music.Well, my lord.Farewell. How now, Ophelia? What’s the matter?O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!With what, i' th' name of God?My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;No hat upon his head; his stockings fouled,Ungartered, and down-gyvèd to his ankle;Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;And with a look so piteous in purportAs if he had been loosèd out of hellTo speak of horrors—he comes before me.Mad for thy love?  My lord, I do not know.But truly, I do fear it.  What said he?He took me by the wrist and held me hard.Then goes he to the length of all his arm,And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,He falls to such perusal of my faceAs he would draw it. Long stayed he so.#LBSFORGOLDAnd I hope he’s studying his music like he’s
                                supposed to.Got it, sir.Good-bye.Ophelia, what’s the matter?Oh, father, father, I’ve just had such a scare!From what, in God’s name?Father, I was up in my room sewing when Hamlet came in with no hat
                                on his head, his shirt unbuttoned, and his stockings dirty, undone,
                                and down around his ankles. He was pale as his undershirt, and his
                                knees were knocking together. He looked so out of sorts, as if
                                he’d just come back from hell. He came up to me.Is he crazy with love for you?I’m not sure, but I’m afraid he might
                            be.What did he say?He grabbed me by the wrist and held me hard, then backed away an
                                arm’s length and just looked at me, staring at me like an
                                artist about to paint my picture. He stayed like that a long
                            time.
