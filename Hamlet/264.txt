    It falls right.You have been talked of since your travel much—And that in Hamlet’s hearing—for a qualityWherein, they say, you shine. Your sum of partsDid not together pluck such envy from himAs did that one, and that, in my regard,Of the unworthiest siege.    What part is that,
                                my lord?A very ribbon in the cap of youth,Yet needful too, for youth no less becomesThe light and careless livery that it wearsThan settled age his sables and his weeds,Importing health and graveness. Two months since,Here was a gentleman of Normandy.I’ve seen myself, and served against, the French,And they can well on horseback. But this gallantHad witchcraft in ’t. He grew unto his seat,And to such wondrous doing brought his horseAs he had been encorpsed and demi-naturedWith the brave beast. So far he topped my thought,That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,Come short of what he did.    A Norman was
                                ’t?A Norman.Upon my life, Lamond!    The very
                            same.I know him well. He is the brooch indeedAnd gem of all the nation.#LBSFORGOLDThat’ll be fine. Since you left, people have been
                                talking about—and within earshot of Hamlet—a
                                certain quality of yours in which, they say, you shine. All your
                                talents and gifts didn’t arouse as much envy from him as
                                this one quality did, though to me it’s far from your
                                best attribute.What quality is that, my lord?A trivial little ribbon on the cap of youth—yet an
                                important one, too, since casual clothes suit young people as much
                                as serious business suits and overcoats suit the middle-aged. Two
                                months ago I met a gentleman from Normandy. I’ve fought
                                against the French and have seen how well they ride, but this man
                                was a magician on horseback. It was as if he were part of the horse,
                                so skillful that even having seen him, I can hardly conceive of the
                                tricks he did.Hmm, he was from Normandy, you say?Yes, from Normandy.I bet it was Lamond.Yes, that’s the one.I know him well. He’s his homeland’s
                            jewel.
