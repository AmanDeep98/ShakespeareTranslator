Two households, both alike in dignity(In fair Verona, where we lay our scene),From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.From forth the fatal loins of these two foesA pair of star-crossed lovers take their life,Whose misadventured piteous overthrowsDoth with their death bury their parents' strife.The fearful passage of their death-marked loveAnd the continuance of their parents' rage,Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove,Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage—The which, if you with patient ears attend,What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.#LBSFORGOLDIn the beautiful city of Verona, where our story takes place, a
                                long-standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence,
                                and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow
                                citizens. Two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers
                                and commit suicide. Their unfortunate deaths put an end to their
                                parents' feud. For the next two hours, we will watch the
                                story of their doomed love and their parents' anger, which
                                nothing but the children’s deaths could stop. If you listen
                                to us patiently, we’ll make up for everything
                                we’ve left out in this prologue onstage.
