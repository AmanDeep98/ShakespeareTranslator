Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongueWhich she hath praised him with above compareSo many thousand times? Go, counselor.Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.I’ll to the friar to know his remedy.If all else fail, myself have power to die.#LBSFORGOLDThat damned old lady! Oh, that most wicked fiend! Is it a worse
                                sin for her to want me to break my vows or for her to say bad things
                                about my husband after she praised him so many times before? Away
                                with you and your advice, Nurse. From now on, I will never tell you
                                what I feel in my heart. I’m going to the Friar to find out
                                his solution. If everything else fails, at least I have the power to
                                take my own life.
