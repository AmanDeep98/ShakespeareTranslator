Who is ’t that calls? Is it my lady mother?Is she not down so late or up so early?What unaccustomed cause procures her hither?Why, how now, Juliet?     Madam,
                                I am not well.Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.Therefore, have done. Some grief shows much of love,But much of grief shows still some want of wit.Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.So shall you feel the loss, but not the friendWhich you weep for.     Feeling
                                so the loss,Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death,As that the villain lives which slaughtered him.What villain, madam?     That
                                same villain, Romeo.#LBSFORGOLDWho’s that calling? Is it my mother? Isn’t she
                                up very late? Or is she up very early? What strange reason could she
                                have for coming here?What’s going on, Juliet?Madam, I am not well.Will you cry about your cousin’s death forever? Are you
                                trying to wash him out of his grave with tears? If you could, you
                                couldn’t bring him back to life. So stop crying. A little
                                bit of grief shows a lot of love. But too much grief makes you look
                                stupid.Let me keep weeping for such a great loss.You will feel the loss, but the man you weep for will feel
                                nothing.Feeling the loss like this, I can’t help but weep for him
                                forever.Well, girl, you’re weeping not for his death as much as
                                for the fact that the villain who killed him is still alive.What villain, madam?That villain, Romeo.
