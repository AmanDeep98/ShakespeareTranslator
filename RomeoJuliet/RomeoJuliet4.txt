Gregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.No, for then we should be colliers.I mean, an we be in choler, we’ll draw.Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.I strike quickly, being moved.But thou art not quickly moved to strike.A dog of the house of Montague moves me.To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.Therefore if thou art moved thou runn’st away.A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.
#LBSFORGOLDGregory, I swear, we can’t let them humiliate us. We
                                won’t take their garbage.

                                we’d be garbagemen.What I mean is, if they make us angry we’ll pull out our
                                swords.Maybe you should focus on pulling yourself out of trouble,

                            angry.Angry enough to run away. You won’t stand and
                            fight.A dog from that house will make me angry enough to take a stand.
                                If I pass one of them on the street, I’ll take the side
                                closer to the wall and let him walk in the gutter.
