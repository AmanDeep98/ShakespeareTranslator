This wind you talk of, blows us from ourselves.Supper is done, and we shall come too late.I fear too early, for my mind misgivesSome consequence yet hanging in the starsShall bitterly begin his fearful dateWith this night’s revels, and expire the termOf a despisèd life closed in my breastBy some vile forfeit of untimely death.But he that hath the steerage of my course,Direct my sail. On, lusty gentlemen.Strike, drum.#LBSFORGOLDThe wind you’re talking about is blowing us off our
                                course. Dinner is over, and we’re going to get there too
                                late.I’m worried we’ll get there too early. I have a
                                feeling this party tonight will be the start of something bad,
                                something that will end with my own death. But whoever’s in
                                charge of where my life’s going can steer me wherever they
                                want. Onward, lover boys!Beat the drum.
