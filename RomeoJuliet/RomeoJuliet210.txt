That “may be” must be, love, on Thursday
                                next.What must be shall be.That’s a certain text.Come you to make confession to this Father?To answer that, I should confess to you.Do not deny to him that you love me.I will confess to you that I love him.So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.If I do so, it will be of more priceBeing spoke behind your back than to your face.Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.The tears have got small victory by that,For it was bad enough before their spite.Thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,And what I spake, I spake it to my face.Thy face is mine, and thou hast slandered it.It may be so, for it is not mine own.—Are you at leisure, holy Father, now,Or shall I come to you at evening mass?#LBSFORGOLDThat “may be” must be, love, on
                            Thursday.What must be will be.That is a certain truth.Have you come to make confession to this father?If I answered that question, I’d be making confession to
                                you.Don’t deny to him that you love me.I’ll confess to you that I love him.You will also confess, I’m sure, that you love me.If I do so, it will mean more if I say it behind your back than if
                                I say it to your face.You poor soul, your face has suffered many tears.The tears haven’t done much because my face looked bad
                                enough before I started to cry.You’re treating your face even worse by saying
                            that.What I say isn’t slander, sir. It’s the truth.
                                And what I said, I said to my face.Your face is mine, and you have slandered it.That may be the case, because my face doesn’t belong to
                                me.—Do you have time for me now, Father, or should I
                                come to you at evening mass?
