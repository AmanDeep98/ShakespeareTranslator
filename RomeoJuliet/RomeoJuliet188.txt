It is, it is. Hie hence! Be gone, away!It is the lark that sings so out of tune,Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.Some say the lark makes sweet division.This doth not so, for she divideth us.Some say the lark and loathèd toad change eyes.Oh, now I would they had changed voices too,Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.More light and light, more dark and dark our woes!Madam.Nurse?Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.The day is broke. Be wary, look about.Then, window, let day in and let life out.Farewell, farewell. One kiss, and I’ll descend.#LBSFORGOLDIt is, it is. Get out of here, be gone, go away! It’s the
                                lark that sings so out of tune, making such harsh noise. Some say
                                the lark makes a sweet division between day and night. It’s
                                not true because she separates us. Some say the lark traded its eyes with the toadA folktale said that the lark had gotten its ugly eyes from the toad, who had taken its pretty eyes from the lark.Some say the lark traded its eyes with the toad. Oh, now I wish they had traded voices too! Because the
                                lark’s voice tears us out of each other’s arms,
                                and now there will be men hunting for you. Oh, go away now. I see
                                more and more light.More and more light. More and more pain for us.Madam.Nurse?Your mother is coming to your bedroom. Day has broken. Be careful.
                                Watch out.Then the window lets day in, and life goes out the window.Farewell, farewell! Give me one kiss, and I’ll go
                            down.
