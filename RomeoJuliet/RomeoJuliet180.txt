Go hence. Good night. And here stands all your state:Either be gone before the watch be set,Or by the break of day disguised from hence.Sojourn in Mantua. I’ll find out your man,And he shall signify from time to timeEvery good hap to you that chances here.Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell, good night.But that a joy past joy calls out on me,It were a grief so brief to part with thee.Farewell.#LBSFORGOLDNow get out of here. Good night. Everything depends on this:
                                either be out of here before the night watchmen take their
                                positions, or leave in disguise after daybreak. Take a little
                                vacation in Mantua. I’ll find your servant, and
                                he’ll update you now and then on your case as it stands
                                here. Give me your hand. It’s late. Farewell. Good
                            night.I’m off to experience the greatest joy of all, but still
                                it’s sad to leave you in such a rush. Farewell.
