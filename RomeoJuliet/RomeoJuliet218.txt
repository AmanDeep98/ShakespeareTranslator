                                cunning cooks.You shall have none ill, sir, for I’ll try if they can
                                lick their fingers.How canst thou try them so?Marry, sir, ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own
                                fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with
                            me.Go, be gone.We shall be much unfurnished for this time.What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?Ay, forsooth.Well, he may chance to do some good on her.A peevish self-willed harlotry it is.#LBSFORGOLD

                                skilled cooks.You won’t get any bad cooks from me. I’ll test
                                them by making them lick their fingers.How can you test them like that?Easy, sir. It’s a bad cook who can’t lick his
                                own fingers. So the cooks who can’t lick their fingers
                                aren’t hired.Go, get out of here.We’re unprepared for this wedding celebration.
