There is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,Doing more murder in this loathsome world,Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.I sell thee poison. Thou hast sold me none.Farewell. Buy food, and get thyself in flesh.—Come, cordial and not poison, go with meTo Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.#LBSFORGOLDI agree because I’m poor, not because I want to.I pay you because you’re poor, not because you want me to
                                buy this.
(gives ROMEO
                                poison) Put this in any kind of
                                liquid you want and drink it down. Even if you were as strong as
                                twenty men, it would kill you immediately.
(gives APOTHECARY
                                money) There is your gold. Money is a
                                worse poison to men’s souls, and commits more murders in
                                this awful world, than these poor poisons that you’re not
                                allowed to sell. I’ve sold
                                you poison. You haven’t sold
                                me any. Goodbye. Buy yourself food, and put some flesh on your
                                bones. I’ll take this mixture, which is a medicine, not a
                                poison, to Juliet’s grave. That’s where I must use
                                it.
