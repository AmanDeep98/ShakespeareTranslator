Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.Musicians, O musicians, “Heart’s
                                Ease,” “Heart’s Ease.”
                                O, an you will have me live, play “Heart’s
                                Ease.”Why “Heart’s ease?”O musicians, because my heart itself plays “My Heart
                                is Full.” O, play me some merry dump to comfort
                            me.Not a dump, we. 'Tis no time to play now.You will not then?No.I will then give it you soundly.What will you give us?No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the
                                minstrel.Then I will give you the serving creature.#LBSFORGOLDHonest good boys, ah, put 'em away, put 'em
                                away. As you know, this is a sad case.Yes, well, things could get better.Musicians, oh, musicians, play “Heart’s
                                Ease,” “Heart’s Ease.”
                                Oh, I’ll die if you don’t play
                                “Heart’s Ease.”Why “Heart’s Ease”?Oh, musicians, because my heart is singing “MyHeart is Full of Woe.” Oh, play me some happy sad song
                                to comfort me.No, not a sad song. It’s not the right time to
                            play.You won’t, then?No.Then I’ll really give it to you.What will you give us?No money, I swear. But I’ll play a trick on you.
                                I’ll call you a minstrel.Then I’ll call you a serving-creature.
