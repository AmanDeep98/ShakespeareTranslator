Where are the vile beginners of this fray?O noble prince, I can discover allThe unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother’s child!O Prince! O cousin! Husband! Oh, the blood is spilledOf my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.O cousin, cousin!   Benvolio, who began this
                                bloody fray?Tybalt here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay.Romeo, that spoke him fair, bade him bethinkHow nice the quarrel was and urged withalYour high displeasure. All this utteredWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bowed,Could not take truce with the unruly spleenOf Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tiltsWith piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beatsCold death aside and with the other sendsIt back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,Retorts it. Romeo, he cries aloud,“Hold, friends! Friends, part!” and,
                                swifter than his tongue,His agile arm beats down their fatal points,And ’twixt them rushes—underneath whose armAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the lifeOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.#LBSFORGOLDWhere are the evil men who started this fight?Oh, noble prince, I can tell you everything about the unfortunate
                                circumstances of this deadly fight. Over there Tybalt is lying dead.
                                He killed your relative, brave Mercutio, and then young Romeo killed
                                him.Tybalt was my nephew! He was my brother’s son! Oh Prince,
                                oh nephew, oh husband! Oh, my nephew is dead! Oh Prince, as you are
                                a man of honor, take revenge for this murder by killing someone from
                                the Montague family. Oh cousin, cousin!Benvolio, who started this fight?Tybalt started the fight before he was killed by Romeo. Romeo
                                spoke to Tybalt politely and told him how silly this argument was.
                                He mentioned that you would not approve of the fight. He said all of
                                this gently and calmly, kneeling down out of respect. But he could
                                not make peace with Tybalt, who was in an angry mood and
                                wouldn’t listen to talk about peace. Tybalt and Mercutio
                                began to fight each other fiercely, lunging at one another and
                                dodging each other’s blows. Romeo cried out,
                                “Stop, my friends. Break it up.” Then he
                                jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down. But
                                Tybalt reached under Romeo’s arm and thrust his sword into
                                brave Mercutio. Then Tybalt fled the scene.
