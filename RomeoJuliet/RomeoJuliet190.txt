Art thou gone so, love, lord? Ay, husband, friend,I must hear from thee every day in the hour,For in a minute there are many days.Oh, by this count I shall be much in yearsEre I again behold my Romeo.     Farewell!I will omit no opportunityThat may convey my greetings, love, to thee.Oh, think’st thou we shall ever meet again?I doubt it not, and all these woes shall serveFor sweet discourses in our time to come.O God, I have an ill-divining soul.Methinks I see thee now, thou art so lowAs one dead in the bottom of a tomb.Either my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!O fortune, fortune! All men call thee fickle.If thou art fickle, what dost thou with himThat is renowned for faith? Be fickle, fortune,For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,But send him back.
(from within) Ho, daughter, are you
                                up?#LBSFORGOLDAre you gone like that, my love, my lord? Yes, my husband, my
                                friend! I must hear from you every day in the hour. In a minute
                                there are many days. Oh, by this count I’ll be many years
                                older before I see my Romeo again.Farewell! I won’t miss any chance to send my love to
                            you.Oh, do you think we’ll ever meet again?I have no doubts. All these troubles will give us stories to tell
                                each other later in life.Oh God, I have a soul that predicts evil things! Now that you are
                                down there, you look like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb.
                                Either my eyesight is failing me, or you look pale.And trust me, love, you look pale to me too. Sadness takes away
                                our color. Goodbye, Goodbye!Oh luck, luck. Everyone says you can’t make up your mind.
                                If you change your mind so much, what are you going to do to Romeo,
                                who’s so faithful? Change your mind, luck. I hope maybe
                                then you’ll send him back home soon.
(offstage) Hey, daughter! Are you
                                awake?
