                                now?Well, that one, I think, is young Petruchio.Who’s the one following over there, the one who
                                wouldn’t dance?I don’t know his name.Go ask. (the nurse leaves) If
                                he’s married, I think I’ll die rather than marry
                                anyone else.
(returning) His name is Romeo.
                                He’s a Montague. He’s the only son of your worst

(to herself) The only man I love is
                                the son of the only man I hate! I saw him too early without knowing
                                who he was, and I found out who he was too late! Love is a monster
                                for making me fall in love with my worst enemy.What’s this? What’s this?Just a rhyme I learned from somebody I danced with at the
                            party.Right away, right away. Come, let’s go. The strangers are
                                all gone.
