But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as
                            you.No better.Well, sir.
(aside to
                                SAMPSON) Say
                                “better.” Here comes one of my
                                master’s kinsmen.
(to
                                ABRAM) Yes, better, sir.You lie.Draw, if you be men.—Gregory, remember thy washing
                                blow.
(draws his sword) Part, fools!Put up your swords. You know not what you do.What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?Turn thee, Benvolio. Look upon thy death.#LBSFORGOLDIf you want to fight, I’m your man. My employer is as
                                good as yours.But he’s not better than mine.Well then.
(speaking so that only SAMPSON
                                can hear) Say
                                “better.” Here comes one of my
                                employer’s relatives.
(to
                                ABRAM) Yes,
                                “better,” sir.You lie.Pull out your swords, if you’re men. Gregory, remember
                                how to slash.(pulling out his sword) Break it
                                up, you fools. Put your swords away. You don’t know what
                                you’re doing.What? You’ve pulled out your sword to fight with these
                                worthless servants? Turn around, Benvolio, and look at the man
                                who’s going to kill you.
