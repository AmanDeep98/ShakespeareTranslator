Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans,Mistlike, infold me from the search of eyes.Hark, how they knock!—Who’s
                                there?—Romeo, arise.Thou wilt be taken.—Stay awhile.—Stand
                            up.Run to my study.—By and by!—God’s
                                will,What simpleness is this!—I come, I come.Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What’s your
                            will?
(from within) Let me come in, and
                                you shall know my errand.I come from Lady Juliet.     
                                (opens the door) Welcome then.O holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar,Where is my lady’s lord? Where’s Romeo?#LBSFORGOLDI won’t hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans
                                envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people’s
                                searching eyes.Listen, they’re still
                                knocking!—(to the person at the door)
                                Who’s there?—(to
                                ROMEO) Romeo, get up.
                                They’ll arrest
                                you.—(to
                                    the person at the door)
                                Hold on a moment.—(to
                                ROMEO) Get up.Run and hide in my study.—Just a
                                minute—For the love of God, why are you being so stupid?
                                I’m coming. I’m coming.Why are you knocking so hard? Where do you come from? What do you
                                want?(from offstage) Let me come in, and
                                I’ll tell you why I came. I come from Lady Juliet.
