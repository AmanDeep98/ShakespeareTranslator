Oh, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,Environèd with all these hideous fears,And madly play with my forefather’s joints,And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud,And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?Oh, look! Methinks I see my cousin’s ghostSeeking out Romeo, that did spit his bodyUpon a rapier’s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!Romeo, Romeo, Romeo! Here’s drink. I drink to
                            thee.#LBSFORGOLDIf I wake up too early, won’t I go insane with all these
                                horrible, frightening things around me, start playing with my
                                ancestors' bones, and pull Tybalt’s corpse out of
                                his death shroud? Will I grab one of my dead ancestor’s
                                bones and bash in my own skull? Oh, look! I think I see my cousin
                                Tybalt’s ghost. He’s looking for Romeo because
                                Romeo killed him with his sword. Wait, Tybalt, wait! Romeo, Romeo,
                                Romeo! Here’s a drink. I drink to you.
