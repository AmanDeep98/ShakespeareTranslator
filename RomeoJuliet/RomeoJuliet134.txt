As much to him, else is his thanks too much.Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joyBe heaped like mine, and that thy skill be moreTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breathThis neighbor air, and let rich music’s tongueUnfold the imagined happiness that bothReceive in either by this dear encounter.Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,Brags of his substance, not of ornament.They are but beggars that can count their worth.But my true love is grown to such excessI cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.Come, come with me, and we will make short work.For, by your leaves, you shall not stay aloneTill holy church incorporate two in one.#LBSFORGOLDI’ll give him equal thanks, so we’re
                            even.Ah, Juliet if you’re as happy as I am, and
                                you’re better with words, tell me about the happiness you
                                imagine we’ll have in our marriage.I can imagine more than I can say—I have more on my
                                mind than words. Anyone who can count how much he has is poor. My
                                true love has made me so rich that I can’t count even half
                                of my wealth.Come, come with me, and we’ll do the job quickly. Because
                                if you don’t mind, I’m not leaving you two alone
                                until you’re united in marriage.
