                                in a grave,To lay one in, another out to have.I pray thee, chide not. Her I love nowDoth grace for grace and love for love allow.The other did not so.   Oh, she knew wellThy love did read by rote, that could not spell.But come, young waverer, come, go with me,In one respect I’ll thy assistant be,For this alliance may so happy proveTo turn your households' rancor to pure love.Oh, let us hence.
