I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,Or manage it to part these men with me.What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word,As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.Have at thee, coward!Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,And flourishes his blade in spite of me.Thou villain Capulet! Hold me not. Let me go.Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.#LBSFORGOLDI’m only trying to keep the peace. Either put away your
                                sword or use it to help me stop this fight.What? You take out your sword and then talk about peace? I hate
                                the word peace like I hate hell, all Montagues, and you.
                                Let’s go at it, coward!Use your clubs and spears! Hit them! Beat them down! Down with the
                                Capulets! Down with the Montagues!What’s this noise? Give me my long sword! Come on!A crutch, you need a crutch—why are you asking for a
                                sword?I want my sword. Old Montague is here, and he’s waving
                                his sword around just to make me mad.Capulet, you villain!
                                (his wife holds him
                                    back)
                                Don’t stop me. Let me go.You’re not taking one step toward an enemy.
