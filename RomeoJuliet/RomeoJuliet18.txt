And private in his chamber pens himself,Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,And makes himself an artificial night.Black and portentous must this humor proveUnless good counsel may the cause remove.My noble uncle, do you know the cause?I neither know it nor can learn of him.Have you importuned him by any means?Both by myself and many other friends.But he, his own affections' counselor,Is to himself—I will not say how true,But to himself so secret and so close,So far from sounding and discovery,As is the bud bit with an envious worm,Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,Or dedicate his beauty to the same.Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.We would as willingly give cure as know.See, where he comes. So please you, step aside.I’ll know his grievance or be much denied.I would thou wert so happy by thy stayTo hear true shrift.—Come, madam, let’s
                            away.#LBSFORGOLDHe locks himself up alone in his bedroom, shuts his windows to
                                keep out the beautiful daylight, and makes himself an artificial
                                night. This mood of his is going to bring bad news, unless someone
                                smart can fix what’s bothering him.My noble uncle, do you know why he acts this way?I don’t know, and he won’t tell me.Have you done everything you could to make him tell you the
                                reason?I’ve tried, and many of our friends have tried to make
                                him talk, but he keeps his thoughts to himself. He doesn’t
                                want any friend but himself, and though I don’t know
                                whether he’s a good friend
                                to himself, he certainly keeps his own secrets. He’s like a
                                flower bud that won’t open itself up to the world because
                                it’s been poisoned from within by parasites. If we could
                                only find out why he’s sad, we’d be as eager to
                                help him as we were to learn the reason for his sadness.Look—here he comes. If you don’t mind, please
                                step aside. He’ll either have to tell me what’s
                                wrong or else tell me no over and over.I hope you’re lucky enough to hear the true story by
                                sticking around. (to his wife) Come,
                                madam, let’s go.
