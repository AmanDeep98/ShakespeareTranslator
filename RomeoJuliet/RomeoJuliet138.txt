An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the
                                fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.The fee simple? O simple!By my head, here comes the Capulets.By my heel, I care not.Follow me close, for I will speak to them.Gentlemen, good e'en. A word with one of you.And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it
                                a word and a blow.You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me
                                occasion.Could you not take some occasion without giving?Mercutio, thou consort’st with Romeo.#LBSFORGOLDIf I were in the habit of fighting the way you are, my life
                                insurance rates would be sky high.Your life insurance? That’s foolish.Oh great, here come the Capulets.Well, well, I don’t care.

                                I’d like to have a word with one of you.You just want one word with one of us? Put it together with
                                something else. Make it a word and a blow.You’ll find me ready enough to do that, sir, if you give
                                me a reason.Can’t you find a reason without my giving you one?Mercutio, you hang out with Romeo.
