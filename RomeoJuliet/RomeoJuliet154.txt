Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,Toward Phoebus' lodging. Such a wagonerAs Phaeton would whip you to the westAnd bring in cloudy night immediately.Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,That runaways' eyes may wink, and RomeoLeap to these arms, untalked of and unseen.Lovers can see to do their amorous ritesBy their own beauties, or, if love be blind,It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,And learn me how to lose a winning matchPlayed for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.Hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks,With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,Think true love acted simple modesty.Come, night. Come, Romeo. Come, thou day in night,For thou wilt lie upon the wings of nightWhiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-browed night,Give me my Romeo. And when I shall die,Take him and cut him out in little stars,And he will make the face of heaven so fineThat all the world will be in love with nightAnd pay no worship to the garish sun.Oh, I have bought the mansion of a love,But not possessed it, and though I am sold,Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is this dayAs is the night before some festivalTo an impatient child that hath new robesAnd may not wear them.#LBSFORGOLDI wish the sun would hurry up and set and night would come
                                immediately. When the night comes and everyone goes to sleep, Romeo
                                will leap into my arms, and no one will know. Beauty makes it
                                possible for lovers to see how to make love in the dark. Or else
                                love is blind, and its best time is the night. I wish night would
                                come, like a widow dressed in black, so I can learn how to submit to
                                my husband and lose my virginity. Let the blood rushing to my cheeks
                                be calmed. In the darkness, let me, a shy virgin, learn the strange
                                act of sex so that it seems innocent, modest, and true. Come, night.
                                Come, Romeo. You’re like a day that comes during the night.
                                You’re whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven.
                                Come, gentle night. Come, loving, dark night. Give me my Romeo. And
                                when I die, turn him into stars and form a constellation in his
                                image. His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world
                                will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun.
                                Oh, I have bought love’s mansion, but I haven’t
                                moved in yet.I belong to Romeo now, but he hasn’t taken
                                possession of me yet. This day is so boring that I feel like a child
                                on the night before a holiday, waiting to put on my fancy new
                                clothes.
