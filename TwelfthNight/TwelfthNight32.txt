Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage, and, for
turning away, let summer bear it out.
You are resolute, then?Not so, neither, but I am resolved on two points.That if one break, the other will hold. Or, if both break,
your gaskins fall.
Apt, in good faith, very apt. Well, go thy way. If Sir Toby
would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve’s
flesh as any in Illyria.
Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my lady.Make your excuse wisely, you were best.
(aside) Wit, an ’t be thy will, put me into good fooling!
Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft prove
fools. And I, that am sure I lack thee, may pass for a wise
man. For what says Quinapalus? “Better a witty fool, than
a foolish wit.”
God bless thee, lady!#LBSFORGOLDSometimes getting killed is a good way to avoid getting married. And as for being fired, it’s summer, so it won’t be that bad to be homeless.You’ve made up your mind, then?No, but I’ve made up my mind on two points.Ah yes, the two points where your suspenders are attached to your buttons. If one breaks, the other will hold, but if both points break, your pants will fall down.Clever, very clever. Well, go along now. You’d be the funniest person in Illyria… if Sir Toby ever stopped drinking.Shut up, you troublemaker, no more of that. Here comes my lady. If you know what’s good for you, you’ll think up some good excuse for being away so long.
(to himself) Please, let me think of something funny to say now! Smart people who think they’re witty often turn out to be fools, but I know I’m not witty, so I might pass for smart. What did that philosopher QuinapalusQuinapalus is a made-up nameQuinapalus say? Ah yes, “A witty fool’s better than a foolish wit.”Greetings to you, madam!
