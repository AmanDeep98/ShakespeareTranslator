   How now! What news from her?So please my lord, I might not be admitted,But from her handmaid do return this answer:The element itself, till seven years' heat,Shall not behold her face at ample view,But like a cloistress, she will veiled walkAnd water once a day her chamber roundWith eye-offending brine—all this to seasonA brother’s dead love, which she would keep freshAnd lasting in her sad remembrance.O, she that hath a heart of that fine frameTo pay this debt of love but to a brother,How will she love, when the rich golden shaftHath killed the flock of all affections elseThat live in her, when liver, brain, and heart,These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and filledHer sweet perfections with one self king!Away before me to sweet beds of flowers.Love thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.#LBSFORGOLDWhat’s going on? What have you heard from her?I’m sorry, but they wouldn’t let me in. But I got the following answer from her handmaid. Olivia’s not going to show her face for the next seven years—not even to the sky itself. Instead, she’ll go around veiled like a nun, and once a day she’ll water her room with tears. She’s doing this out of love for her dead brother, whom she wants to keep fresh in her memory forever.Oh, if she loves her brother this much, think how she’ll love me when I finally win her over and make her forget all her other attachments! Her mind and heart will be ruled by one man alone—me! Take me to the garden. I need a beautiful place to sit and think about love.
