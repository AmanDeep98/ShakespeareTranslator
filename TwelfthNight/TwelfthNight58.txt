Ourselves we do not owe.What is decreed must be, and be this so.#LBSFORGOLDMadam, I will.I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m afraid I’m not using my head, and I’m falling for his good looks. Fate, do your work. We human beings don’t control our own destinies. What is fated to happen must happen. So let it happen!
