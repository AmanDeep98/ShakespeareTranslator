By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper, and light,
and convey what I will set down to my lady. It shall
advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did.
I will help you to ’t. But tell me true, are you not mad
indeed? Or do you but counterfeit?
Believe me, I am not. I tell thee true.Nay, I’ll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains. I will
fetch you light, and paper, and ink.
Fool, I’ll requite it in the highest degree. I prithee, be gone.
(sings)

   I am gone, sir,

   And anon, sir,

   I’ll be with you again,

   In a trice,

   Like to the old Vice,

   Your need to sustain,

   Who, with dagger of lath

   In his rage and his wrath,

   Cries “Aha,” to the devil,

   Like a mad lad,

   “Pare thy nails, dad,

   Adieu, goodman devil.”
#LBSFORGOLDI swear I am. Get me some ink, paper, and a candle. I’ll write a letter and you’ll take it to my lady. You’ll get a bigger reward than you ever got delivering a letter before.I’ll help you. But tell me honestly, are you sure you’re not insane? Or are you just pretending?Believe me, I’m not. I’m telling the truth.I’ll never believe a madman until I can see his brains. But I’ll get you a candle and paper and ink.Fool, I’ll repay you for this favor. Please, hurry.
(he sings)

   I’m going now, sir, but soon

   I’ll be with you again,

   To help you resist the devil,

   Like the sidekick in the old plays

   Who shakes a wooden dagger,

   Fumes in rage and wrath,

   And shouts “Whoa!” to the devil.

   He yells, “Trim your nails, old man.

   And goodbye, Satan, you peasant.”
