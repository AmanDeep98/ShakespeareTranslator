Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.Anything.Do not desire to see this letter.This is, to give a dog and in recompense desire my dog
again.
Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings.I know thee well. How dost thou, my good fellow?Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse for my
friends.
Just the contrary. The better for thy friends.No, sir, the worse.How can that be?#LBSFORGOLDIf you’re my friend, you’ll let me see his letter.Dear Mr. Fabian, do me another favor first.Anything.Don’t ask to see this letter.That’s like giving someone a dog as a present, and then asking for the dog back in return.My friends, are you all Lady Olivia’s servants?Yes, sir, we’re part of her entourage.I know you. How are you, my friend?I’m better off because of my enemies, and worse off because of my friends.You mean it the other way around. You’re better off because of your friends.No, sir, worse off.How can that be?
