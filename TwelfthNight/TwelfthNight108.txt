“I may command where I adore,But silence, like a Lucrece knife,With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore;M.O.A.I. doth sway my life.”(aside) A fustian riddle!(aside) Excellent wench, say I.“M.O.A.I. doth sway my life.” Nay, but first, let me see, let
me see, let me see.
(aside) What dish o' poison has she dressed him!(aside) And with what wing the staniel checks at it!“I may command where I adore.” Why, she may command
me. I serve her, she is my lady. Why, this is evident to any
formal capacity. There is no obstruction in this. And the
end—what should that alphabetical position portend? If I
could make that resemble something in me—Softly!
M.O.A.I.—
(aside) O, ay, make up that.—He is now at a cold scent.
(aside) Sowter will cry upon ’t for all this, though it be as

“I may order the one I love.But silence, like a knife, cuts open my heartWith strokes that draw no blood.M.O.A.I. rules my life.”
(whispering) What a pretentious riddle!
(whispering) That Maria has outdone herself!“M.O.A.I. rules my life.” Hmm, let me see, let me see, let me see.
(whispering) What a dish of poison she’s mixed for him!
(whispering) And look how willingly he’s taking the bait.“I may command the one I love.” Well, she commands me. I’m her servant. She’s my boss. Why, anyone can see what this means. There’s no ambiguity here. But the end, what do those letters mean? If only I could somehow relate them to me! Hmm. M.O.A.I.—
(whispering) Oh, bad dog.—He’s losing the scent!
(whispering) He’ll find it again, no matter how much it stinks.
