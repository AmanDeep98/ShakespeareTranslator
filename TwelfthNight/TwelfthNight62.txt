A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was
yet of many accounted beautiful. But though I could not
with such estimable wonder overfar believe that, yet thus
far I will boldly publish her: she bore a mind that envy
could not but call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt
water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again
with more.
Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your
servant.
If you will not undo what you have done—that is, kill him
whom you have recovered—desire it not. Fare you well at
once. My bosom is full of kindness, and I am yet so near the
manners of my mother, that upon the least occasion more
mine eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to the Count
Orsino’s court. Farewell.
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!I have many enemies in Orsino’s court,Else would I very shortly see thee there.But, come what may, I do adore thee soThat danger shall seem sport, and I will go.#LBSFORGOLDAlthough many people said she looked like me, she was considered beautiful. And though I can’t believe everything people said about her beauty, I’ll be so bold as to say she had a beautiful mind. Even those who were jealous of her would have to admit that. She’s been drowned in salty sea water, and now my salty tears are about to drown her memory all over again.I’m sorry I wasn’t a better host for you, sir.Oh, Antonio, I’m sorry I caused you so much trouble.I care about you a lot. Please let me be your servant so I can be with you. You’ll be killing me if you don’t.If you don’t want to break my heart, then say goodbye to me right now. I like you very much. I’m really about to cry, just like my mother would do. I’m going to Count Orsino’s court. Goodbye.I wish you all the best. If I didn’t have so many enemies in Orsino’s court, I’d go join you there. But who cares. I’m so crazy about you that danger doesn’t bother me. I’ll go anyway.
