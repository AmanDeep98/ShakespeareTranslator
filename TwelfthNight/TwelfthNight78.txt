(sings) Shall I bid him go?

(sings) What an if you do?

(sings) Shall I bid him go, and spare not?

(sings) O no, no, no, no, you dare not.
Out o' tune, sir. You lie. Art any more than a steward? Dost
thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no
more cakes and ale?
Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the mouth too.Thou'rt i' the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with crumbs. A
stoup of wine, Maria!
Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady’s favor at anything
more than contempt, you would not give means for this
uncivil rule. She shall know of it, by this hand.
Go shake your ears!'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man’s a-hungry,
to challenge him the field and then to break promise with
him and make a fool of him.
Do ’t, knight. I’ll write thee a challenge. Or I’ll deliver thy
indignation to him by word of mouth.

(singing) Should I tell him to go?

(singing) What if y,ou do?

(singing) Should I tell him to go, and be harsh with him?

(singing) Oh no, no, no, no, don’t you dare.
That’s out of tune, sir. You lie. (to MALVOLIO) You’re nothing more than a servant here. Do you think that just because you’re a goody two shoes, no one else can enjoy himself?They certainly will. They’ll have double helpings, too.You’re right. (to MALVOLIO) Go polish your steward’s chain, sir. Maria, bring us some wine!Miss Mary, if you cared what Lady Olivia thinks about you at all, you wouldn’t contribute to this rude behavior. I assure you, she’ll find out about this.Go and wiggle your ears!There’s nothing I’d love more than to make a fool out of that guy somehow. I could challenge him to a duel and then not show up. That would do the trick.Do that. I’ll write a letter challenging him to a duel on your behalf. Or I’ll deliver your insults to his face.
