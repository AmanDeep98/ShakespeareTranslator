A blank, my lord. She never told her love,But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,Feed on her damask cheek. She pined in thought,And with a green and yellow melancholyShe sat like patience on a monument,Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?We men may say more, swear more, but indeedOur shows are more than will, for still we proveMuch in our vows, but little in our love.But died thy sister of her love, my boy?I am all the daughters of my father’s house,And all the brothers too—and yet I know not.Sir, shall I to this lady?   Ay, that’s the theme.To her in haste. Give her this jewel. SayMy love can give no place, bide no denay.
(he hands her a jewel)
#LBSFORGOLDThere was no story, my lord. She never told him she loved him. She kept her love bottled up inside her until it destroyed her, ruining her beauty. She pined away. She just sat waiting patiently, sadly, smiling despite her sadness. Her complexion turned greenish from depression. Doesn’t that sound like true love? We men might talk more and promise more, but in fact we talk more than we really feel. We might be great at making vows, but our love isn’t sincere.But did your sister die of love?I am the only daughter in my father’s family, and all the brothers too—but I’m not completely sure about that. Anyway, sir, should I go see the lady?Yes, go quickly and give her this jewel. Tell her my love won’t go away and won’t be denied. (he hands her a jewel)
