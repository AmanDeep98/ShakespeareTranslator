Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard. Make him
believe thou art Sir Topas the curate. Do it quickly. I’ll call
Sir Toby the whilst.
Well, I’ll put it on, and I will dissemble myself in ’t, and I
would I were the first that ever dissembled in such a gown.
I am not tall enough to become the function well, nor lean
enough to be thought a good student, but to be said an
honest man and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say
a careful man and a great scholar. The competitors enter.
Jove bless thee, master Parson.Bonos dies, Sir Toby. For, as the old hermit of Prague, that
never saw pen and ink, very wittily said to a niece of King
Gorboduc, “That that is is.” So I, being Master Parson, am
Master Parson. For, what is “that” but “that,” and “is” but
“is”?
To him, Sir Topas.#LBSFORGOLDNo, I’m telling you, put on this robe and beard. Make him think you’re Sir Topas the priest. Be quick. Meanwhile, I’ll get Sir Toby.Well, I’ll put it on and disguise myself. I wish I were the first person who ever told lies in a priest’s robe.I’m not tall enough to make a believable priest, or skinny enough to look like a good student. But if you’re an honest man and a good host, that’s almost as good as being moral and studious. Here come the conspirators.God bless you, Mr. Priest.
Bonos diesThe fool is saying hello in an imitation of Latin.Bonos dies, Sir Toby. As the old hermit of Prague, who couldn’t read or write, said very wittily to a niece of King Gorboduc, “Whatever is, is.” So since I’m Mr. Priest, I’m Mr. Priest. Because isn’t “that” “that,” and isn’t “is” “is”?Go to him, Sir Topas.
