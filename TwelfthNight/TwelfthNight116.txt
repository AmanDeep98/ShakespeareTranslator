Nay, but say true, does it work upon him?Like aqua vitae with a midwife.If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark his first
approach before my lady. He will come to her in yellow
stockings, and ’tis a color she abhors, and cross-gartered, a
fashion she detests. And he will smile upon her, which will
now be so unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to
a melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him into a
notable contempt. If you will see it, follow me.
To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!I’ll make one too.#LBSFORGOLDDid it really work?Like medicine for a sick man.If you want to really have some fun, watch him next time he’s near Lady Olivia. He’ll show up in yellow stockings—she hates yellow—and with laces crisscrossing up his legs—she hates that style of dress—and he’ll smile, which will go completely against her mood, since she’s addicted to sadness now. She’ll definitely get upset with him. If you want to watch, follow me.I’d follow you to the gates of Hell, you sneaky little devil!I’ll come too.
