Go you, Malvolio. If it be a suit from the count, I am sick,
or not at home. What you will, to dismiss it.
Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and people
dislike it.
Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son
should be a fool, whose skull Jove cram with brains, for—
here he comes—one of thy kin has a most weak pia mater.
By mine honor, half-drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?A gentleman.A gentleman? What gentleman?'Tis a gentleman here—a plague o' these pickle herring!How now, sot!Good Sir Toby!Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this
lethargy?
#LBSFORGOLDGo out and talk to this visitor, Malvolio. If he’s got a message from the count, tell him I’m sick, or not home. Tell him anything you want, as long as you make him go away.Now you see how your fooling gets boring, and people don’t like it.Madam, you’ve spoken so highly of us fools, you’d think your oldest son was going into that line of work. I hope God crams his skull full of brains, because here comes one of your relatives who’s pretty weak in the head.I swear, he’s half drunk already. Who’s that at the gate, uncle?A gentleman.A gentleman? What gentleman?There’s some gentleman out there.—(belching) Damn these pickled herring! They upset my stomach. How’s it going, fool?Good Sir Toby!Uncle, uncle, how are you already so brain-dead so early in the day?
