(to MARIA) Bless you, fair shrew.And you too, sir.Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.What’s that?My niece’s chambermaid.Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.My name is Mary, sir.Good Mistress Mary Accost—You mistake, knight. “Accost” is front her, board her, woo
her, assail her.
By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is
that the meaning of “accost”?
Fare you well, gentlemen. (she starts to exit)
An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never
draw sword again.
An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword
again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?
Sir, I have not you by the hand.#LBSFORGOLD
(to MARIA) And hello to you, my little wench.Hello, sir.Chat her up, Sir Andrew. Chat her up.What?This is my niece’s maid.My dear Miss Chat-her-up, I look forward to getting to know you better.My name is Mary, sir.Miss Mary Chat-her-up—No, you’ve got it wrong. When I said “chat her up,” I wasn’t saying her name. I was telling you to go after her, woo her, confront her.Good heavens, I’d never do that with people watching. Is that really what you meant?Goodbye, gentlemen. (she starts to exit)
She’s leaving. If you let her go this easily, Sir Andrew, you don’t deserve to ever use your sword again.If you leave like this, my dear, I won’t ever use my sword again. I’m not just talking nonsense to you, I mean everything I say. Do you think you’ve got a couple of fools on your hands here?I’m not holding your hand, sir.
