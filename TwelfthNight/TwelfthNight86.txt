Give me some music. (music plays)Now, good morrow, friends.—Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,That old and antique song we heard last night.Methought it did relieve my passion much,More than light airs and recollected termsOf these most brisk and giddy-paced times:Come, but one verse.He is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it.Who was it?Feste, the jester, my lord, a fool that the lady Olivia’s father
took much delight in. He is about the house.
Seek him out, and play the tune the while.(to VIOLA) Come hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love,In the sweet pangs of it remember me;For such as I am, all true lovers are,Unstaid and skittish in all motions elseSave in the constant image of the creatureThat is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?It gives a very echo to the seatWhere Love is throned.#LBSFORGOLDPlay me some music. (music plays) Good morning, my friends.—Have them sing me that song again, Cesario, that old-fashioned song someone sang last night. It made me feel better and took my mind off my troubles much better than the silly songs they sing nowadays. Please, have them sing just one verse.Sir, the person who should sing that song isn’t here.Who was it?Feste, the jester, my lord. Olivia’s father used to like him. He’s somewhere else in the house.Then go find him. Meanwhile, play the tune.(to VIOLA) Come here, boy. If you ever fall in love and feel the bittersweet pain it brings, think of me. Because the way I am now, moody and unable to focus on anything except the face of the woman I love, is exactly how all true lovers are. What do you think of this song?It really makes you feel what a lover feels.
