Come to what is important in ’t. I forgive you the praise.Alas, I took great pains to study it, and ’tis poetical.It is the more like to be feigned. I pray you, keep it in. I
heard you were saucy at my gates and allowed your
approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you
be not mad, be gone. If you have reason, be brief. 'Tis not
that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a
dialogue.
Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer. Some
mollification for your giant, sweet lady.
Tell me your mind.I am a messenger.Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the
courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.
It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war, no
taxation of homage. I hold the olive in my hand. My words
are as full of peace as matter.
Yet you began rudely. What are you? What would you?#LBSFORGOLDGet to the point now. I’ll let you get away with skipping the praise.That’s too bad, because I spent a long time memorizing it, and it’s poetic.That means it’s more likely to be fake. Please, keep it to yourself. I heard you were rude when you were standing outside my gate, and that’s the only reason I let you in. I was curious. But I don’t necessarily want to listen to you. If you’re just insane, then get out of here. If you’re in your right mind, get to the point. I’ve got no patience for lunacy at the moment, and I don’t want to waste my time on ridiculous conversations.Ready to set sail, sir? The door’s right here.No, this boat’s docking here a bit longer, little sailor.—My lady, would you mind asking your giant here to back off a bit?Tell me what you want.I have a message to deliver.It must be a message about something horrible, since you deliver it so rudely. Tell me what it’s about.It’s about you. I’m not bringing any declarations of war or demands for cash. I’m coming in peace.But you began so rudely. Who are you? What do you want?
