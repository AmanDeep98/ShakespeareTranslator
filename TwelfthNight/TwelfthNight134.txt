No, faith, I’ll not stay a jot longer.Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.Marry, I saw your niece do more favors to the Count’s
servingman than ever she bestowed upon me. I saw ’t i' the
orchard.
Did she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me that.As plain as I see you now.This was a great argument of love in her toward you.'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment
and reason.
And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was
a sailor.
She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to
exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valor, to put fire in
your heart and brimstone in your liver. You should then
have accosted her, and with some excellent jests, fire-new
from the mint, you should have banged the youth into
dumbness.
#LBSFORGOLDNo, I won’t stay a second longer.Why are you leaving, my angry friend?Yes, you have to tell us why, Sir Andrew.Well, because I saw your niece Olivia treat the count’s messenger better than she’s ever treated me. I saw it in the orchard.Did she see you there the whole time, old boy? Tell me that.Yes, she saw me quite clearly.Well, that proves she’s in love with you.Are you trying to make fun of me?No, I’ll prove it with airtight evidence and logical argument.And you can’t deny evidence and argument—They’ve been around since Noah’s ark.She flirted with the messenger boy to exasperate you, fire up your passions, and make you angry and jealous. You should have run up to her, unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot, and rendered the young man speechless.
