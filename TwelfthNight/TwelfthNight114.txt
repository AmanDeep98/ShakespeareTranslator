Jove, I thank thee! I will smile. I will do everything that
thou wilt have me.
I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of
thousands to be paid from the Sophy.
I could marry this wench for this device.So could I too.And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.Nor I neither.Here comes my noble gull-catcher.Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?Or o' mine either?Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip, and become thy
bondslave?
I' faith, or I either?Why, thou hast put him in such a dream that when the
image of it leaves him he must run mad.
#LBSFORGOLDDear God, thank you! I’ll do everything she wants me to do.I wouldn’t have missed this even for a pension of thousands of pounds, to be paid by the shah of Persia.I could marry that Maria for thinking this up.So could I.And I wouldn’t ask for any dowry except for her to play another trick like this one.Neither would I.Here she comes, the brilliant fool-catcher.May I kiss your feet?And I too?Shall I be your slave?Me too.You’ve made him so delusional he’ll go crazy when he learns the truth.
