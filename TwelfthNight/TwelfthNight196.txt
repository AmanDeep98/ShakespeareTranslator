Madman, thou errest. I say, there is no darkness but
ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than the
Egyptians in their fog.
I say, this house is as dark as ignorance, though ignorance
were as dark as hell. And I say, there was never man thus
abused. I am no more mad than you are. Make the trial of
it in any constant question.
What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl?That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.What thinkest thou of his opinion?I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness. Thou shalt
hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits,
and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of
thy grandam. Fare thee well.
Sir Topas, Sir Topas!My most exquisite Sir Topas!Nay, I am for all waters.Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown.He sees thee not.#LBSFORGOLDYou’re wrong, you madman. There’s no darkness except ignorance, and you’re more ignorant than the Egyptians during the plague of fog.I tell you, this house is as dark as ignorance. And I tell you, no man has ever been treated worse than me. I’m no more insane than you are, and I’ll prove it. Ask me any commonsense question.What was the philosopher Pythagoras’s belief about wild birds?That our grandmother’s soul could end up inhabiting a bird.What do you think of his belief?I respect the soul very much, so I disagree with his belief.Well then, goodbye. Stay in the dark. I’ll only admit that you’re sane when you agree with Pythagoras and hesitate to kill a bird because it might contain your grandmother’s soul. Goodbye.Sir Topas, Sir Topas!The brilliant Sir Topas!I can do anything!You could’ve done this without your beard and gown. He couldn’t see you.
