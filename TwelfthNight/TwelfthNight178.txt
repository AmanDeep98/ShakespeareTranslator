What will you do, now my necessityMakes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves meMuch more for what I cannot do for youThan what befalls myself. You stand amazed,But be of comfort.   Come, sir, away.
(to VIOLA) I must entreat of you some of that money.What money, sir?For the fair kindness you have showed me here,And part being prompted by your present trouble,Out of my lean and low abilityI’ll lend you something. My having is not much.I’ll make division of my present with you.Hold, there’s half my coffer. (offering him money)
   Will you deny me now?Is ’t possible that my deserts to youCan lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,Lest that it make me so unsound a manAs to upbraid you with those kindnessesThat I have done for you.   I know of none,Nor know I you by voice or any feature.I hate ingratitude more in a manThan lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,Or any taint of vice whose strong corruptionInhabits our frail blood—   O heavens themselves!Come, sir, I pray you, go.#LBSFORGOLDI’m more upset about not being able to help you than I am about what’s going to happen to me. You look so confused. Don’t worry about me.Come on, sir, let’s go.
(to VIOLA) Really, I must ask you for some of that money.What money, sir? I feel sorry for you in this situation, and I want to thank you for the kindness you’ve shown me here, so I’ll lend you some of my money, though I don’t have much. I’ll give you half of everything I have right now. Take this. It’s half of all my money. (she offers him money)
Are you really going to pretend you don’t know me now? After everything I’ve done for you, you’re refusing to help me? Don’t make me more miserable than I am. I might do something really weak and unmanly, like listing the kind things I’ve done for you.I don’t know any kind things you’ve done for me, and I don’t recognize your voice or your face. I hate an ungrateful man more than I hate lying, vanity, babbling, drunkenness, or any other vice that we feeble human beings are susceptible to.—Oh, my God!Come on, sir, please. Let’s go.
