Gentleman, God save thee.And you, sir.That defense thou hast, betake thee to ’t. Of what nature
the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not, but thy
intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends
thee at the orchard end. Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy
preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skillful and deadly.
You mistake, sir. I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me.
My remembrance is very free and clear from any image of
offense done to any man.
You’ll find it otherwise, I assure you. Therefore, if you hold
your life at any price, betake you to your guard, for your
opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath
can furnish man withal.
I pray you, sir, what is he?He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet
consideration, but he is a devil in private brawl. Souls and
bodies hath he divorced three, and his incensement at this
moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but
by pangs of death and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word.
“Give ’t or take ’t.”
#LBSFORGOLDHello, sir.Hello to you.You’d better think up a way to defend yourself. I don’t know what you’ve done to upset him, but someone has challenged you to a duel. He’s riled up and bloodthirsty, and he’s waiting for you at the back of the orchard. Draw your sword and get on your toes, because your assailant is quick, skillful, and deadly.There must be some mistake, sir. I’m sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me. I can’t remember anything I’ve ever done to offend anyone.You’re wrong about that, I assure you. So if you value your life at all, be on your guard. Your opponent has enough youth, strength, skill, and anger to outfight anyone.But who is this person, sir?He’s a knight. He was made a knight because of his court connections, but when he’s fighting a civilian he’s a real monster. He’s killed three people, and he’s so furious right now that the only thing that will satisfy him is seeing you die. “Fight to the death” is his motto.
