You, sir? Why, what are you?One, sir, that for his love dares yet do moreThan you have heard him brag to you he will.Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.O good Sir Toby, hold! Here come the officers.
(to ANTONIO) I’ll be with you anon.
(to ANDREW) Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.Marry, will I, sir. And for that I promised you, I’ll be as
good as my word. He will bear you easily and reins well.
This is the man. Do thy office.Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.You do mistake me, sir.No, sir, no jot. I know your favor well,Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.—Take him away. He knows I know him well.I must obey. (to VIOLA) This comes with seeking you:But there’s no remedy. I shall answer it.#LBSFORGOLDYou, sir? Who are you?I’m just a good friend of his. In fact, I’d do even more to him than what you’ve heard him promise to do.If you’re someone who gets into fights, I’ll fight with you.Oh, Sir Toby, stop! The police are here.
(to ANTONIO) I’ll be back for you soon.
(to ANDREW) Please, sir, put away your sword. Please.I certainly will, sir. And as for what I promised to you, I’m as good as my word.

Do your job.Antonio, you’re under arrest on the orders of Count Orsino.You must be mistaking me for someone else, sir.No, sir, not at all. I recognize your face perfectly, even without a sailor’s cap on your head.—Take him away. He knows I recognize him.I have to obey. (to VIOLA) This has happened because I came looking for you, but there’s nothing I can do about it now. I’ll take what’s coming to me. But what’ll you do now that I have to ask you for my purse back?
