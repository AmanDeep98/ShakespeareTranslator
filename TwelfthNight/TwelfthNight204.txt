This is the air, that is the glorious sun.This pearl she gave me, I do feel ’t and see ’t,And though ’tis wonder that enwraps me thus,Yet ’tis not madness. Where’s Antonio, then?I could not find him at the Elephant.Yet there he was, and there I found this credit,That he did range the town to seek me out.His counsel now might do me golden service.For though my soul disputes well with my senseThat this may be some error, but no madness,Yet doth this accident and flood of fortuneSo far exceed all instance, all discourse,That I am ready to distrust mine eyesAnd wrangle with my reason that persuades meTo any other trust but that I am mad—Or else the lady’s mad. Yet if ’twere so,She could not sway her house, command her followers,Take and give back affairs and their dispatchWith such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearingAs I perceive she does. There’s something in ’tThat is deceivable. But here the lady comes.#LBSFORGOLDThis is the air, that’s the glorious sun. I can feel and see this pearl she gave me. I may be dazed and confused, but I’m not insane. Where’s Antonio, then? I didn’t find him at the Elephant. But he’d been there before me, and they told me he’d gone out looking for me. I could really use his advice right now. I feel sure this situation is due to some mistake, and I don’t think I’m crazy. But this sudden flood of good luck is so unbelievable that I’m ready to distrust my own eyes and my own rational mind when they tell me I’m not insane—maybe the lady’s insane. But if that were the case, she wouldn’t be able to run her house, command her servants, listen to reports, make decisions, and take care of business as smoothly as she does. There’s something going on that’s not what it seems. But here she comes.
