What country, friends, is this?     This is Illyria, lady.And what should I do in Illyria?My brother he is in Elysium.Perchance he is not drown’d.—What think you, sailors?It is perchance that you yourself were saved.O, my poor brother! And so perchance may he be.True, madam. And, to comfort you with chance,Assure yourself, after our ship did split,When you and those poor number saved with youHung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,Most provident in peril, bind himself,Courage and hope both teaching him the practice,To a strong mast that lived upon the sea,Where, like Arion on the dolphin’s back,I saw him hold acquaintance with the wavesSo long as I could see.

   For saying so, there’s gold.Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,Whereto thy speech serves for authority,The like of him. Know’st thou this country?Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and bornNot three hours' travel from this very place.#LBSFORGOLDWhat country is this, friends?This is Illyria, lady.And what am I supposed to do in Illyria? My brother is in heaven. Or maybe there’s a chance he didn’t drown.—What do you think, sailors?It was a total fluke that you yourself were saved.Oh, my poor brother! But maybe by some fluke he was saved too.It’s possible, ma'am. Don’t give up yet. When our ship was wrecked and you and a few other survivors were clinging onto our lifeboat, I saw your brother tie himself to a big mast floating in the sea. He was acting resourcefully and courageously in a dangerous situation. For as long as I could see him, he stayed afloat on the waves like ArionArion was a Greek poet who was saved from drowning by a dolphin.Arion on the dolphin’s back.
(giving him money) Thank you for saying that—here’s some money to express my gratitude. Since I survived, it’s easier for me to imagine he survived too, and what you say gives me a reason to hope for the best. Do you know this area we’re in?Yes, ma'am, I know it well. I was born and raised less than three hours from here.
