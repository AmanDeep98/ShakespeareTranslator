Let’s to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for more money.If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.Send for money, knight. If thou hast her not i' the end, call
me “Cut.”
If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.Come, come, I’ll go burn some sack. 'Tis too late to go to
bed now. Come, knight. Come, knight.
#LBSFORGOLDLet’s go to bed, knight. Tomorrow you need to get more money sent to you.If I can’t persuade your niece to marry me, I’m going to be in some serious financial trouble.Get your hands on some money and everything will be all right. I know you’ll win over Olivia in the end.I know I will too, if it’s the last thing I do.Come on, I’ll go warm up a nice glass of sherry for us. It’s too late to go to bed now. Come on, my friend, come on.
