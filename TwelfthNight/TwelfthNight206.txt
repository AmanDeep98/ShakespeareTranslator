(to SEBASTIAN)
Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,Now go with me and with this holy manInto the chantry by. There, before himAnd underneath that consecrated roof,Plight me the full assurance of your faith,That my most jealous and too doubtful soulMay live at peace. He shall conceal itWhiles you are willing it shall come to note,What time we will our celebration keepAccording to my birth. What do you say?I’ll follow this good man, and go with you;And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shineThat they may fairly note this act of mine.#LBSFORGOLD
(to SEBASTIAN) Don’t be angry with me for acting so quickly. If your intentions toward me are honorable, come with me and this holy man into the chapel over there, where you can soothe all my worries by making your marriage vows to me. The priest will keep it secret until you’re ready to make the news public and we can throw a full marriage celebration that befits my social standing. What do you say?I’ll follow the priest and go with you; and after I’ve sworn to be faithful, I’ll be faithful forever.Then lead the way, father. I want the skies bright and shining to show its approval of our wedding.
