O Lord!
(to MARIA) Prithee, hold thy peace. This is not the way. Do
you not see you move him? Let me alone with him.
No way but gentleness, gently, gently. The fiend is rough
and will not be roughly used.

(to MALVOLIO) Why, how now, my bawcock! How dost thou,
chuck?
Sir!Ay, Biddy, come with me.—What, man! 'Tis not for
gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan. Hang him, foul
collier!
Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.My prayers, minx?
(to SIR TOBY BELCH) No, I warrant you, he will not hear of
godliness.
Go, hang yourselves all! You are idle, shallow things. I am
not of your element. You shall know more hereafter.
#LBSFORGOLDOh, Lord!
(to MARIA) Please, keep quiet. This is not the way to act. Don’t you see you’re upsetting him? Leave me alone with him.Gentleness is the only way to go—gently, gently. The devil inside him is rough, but we can’t treat it roughly.
(to the imaginary devil inside MALVOLIO) So how are you, my pretty little bird? How are you doing in there, sweet little chicken?Sir!Yes, dear little chick, come along with me.—Shut up, man! You’re serious enough to know not to play games with Satan. Damn that dirty black coalminer of a devil!Get him to say his prayers, Sir Toby, get him to pray.My prayers, you hussy?
(to SIR TOBY BELCH) No, I’m telling you, he refuses to hear anything about religion.Go hang yourselves, all of you! You’re all lazy and shallow. I’m not like you. I have a higher future waiting for me. You’ll know more about it later.
