If the duke continue these favors towards you, Cesario, you
are like to be much advanced. He hath known you but three
days, and already you are no stranger.
You either fear his humor or my negligence, that you call in
question the continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir, in
his favors?
No, believe me.I thank you. Here comes the count.Who saw Cesario, ho?On your attendance, my lord, here.
(to VIOLA and attendants)
Stand you a while aloof. (to VIOLA) Cesario,Thou know’st no less but all. I have unclaspedTo thee the book even of my secret soul.Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;Be not denied access, stand at her doors,And tell them there thy fixed foot shall growTill thou have audience.#LBSFORGOLDIf the Duke keeps treating you so well, Cesario, you’ll go far. He’s only known you for three days, but he’s already treating you like a close friend.When you wonder whether he’ll keep treating me well, it makes me think his mood might change—or else I’ll mess up somehow. Do his feelings toward people change suddenly?No, not at all.Thanks for telling me. Here comes the Duke now.Has anyone seen Cesario?I’m right here, my lord, at your service.
(to VIOLA and attendants) We’ll need some privacy for a little while. (to VIOLA) Cesario, I want a word with you. You know everything about me. I’ve told you all the secrets of my soul. So please go to her house; if they don’t let you in, plant yourself outside her door and tell them you won’t leave until they let you see her.
