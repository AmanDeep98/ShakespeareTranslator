Here he comes with your niece. Give them way till he take
leave, and presently after him.
I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a
challenge.
I have said too much unto a heart of stoneAnd laid mine honor too unchary on ’t.There’s something in me that reproves my fault,But such a headstrong potent fault it isThat it but mocks reproof.With the same 'havior that your passion bearsGoes on my master’s grief.Here, wear this jewel for me. 'Tis my picture.Refuse it not. It hath no tongue to vex you.And I beseech you come again tomorrow.What shall you ask of me that I’ll deny,That honor, saved, may upon asking give?Nothing but this: your true love for my master.How with mine honor may I give him thatWhich I have given to you?I will acquit you.Well, come again tomorrow. Fare thee well.A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.#LBSFORGOLDHere comes the messenger with your niece. Leave them alone until he sets off home, and then follow him.Meanwhile, I’ll think of some horrible way to phrase the challenge.I’ve said too much to someone with a heart of stone. I’ve foolishly jeopardized my honor and reputation. I hate myself for behaving that way, but I just had to, and no criticism could have stopped me.My lord acts just as crazy with love as you do.Here, take this piece of jewelry. There’s a picture of me inside. Don’t refuse it. It won’t annoy you like me, because it doesn’t have a voice. And I beg you, please come here again tomorrow. What could you possibly ask of me that I wouldn’t give you, as long as it didn’t damage my honor and self-respect?Nothing, except your true love for my lord.How could I honorably give him what I’ve already given you?I’ll give it back to you.Just come again tomorrow. Good-bye. A devil like you could lead me to hell.
