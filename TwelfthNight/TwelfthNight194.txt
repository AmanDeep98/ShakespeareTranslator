(disguising his voice) What ho, I say! Peace in this prison!The knave counterfeits well. A good knave.(from within) Who calls there?Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio the
lunatic.
Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady—Out, hyperbolical fiend! How vexest thou this man! Talkest
thou nothing but of ladies?
(aside) Well said, Master Parson.Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged. Good Sir Topas,
do not think I am mad. They have laid me here in hideous
darkness.
Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most modest
terms, for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the
devil himself with courtesy. Sayest thou that house is dark?
As hell, Sir Topas.Why, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes, and
the clerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as
ebony. And yet complainest thou of obstruction?
I am not mad, Sir Topas. I say to you this house is dark.#LBSFORGOLD
(disguising his voice) Quiet down in this prison!The fool’s a good actor. A good fool.
(offstage) Who’s shouting?I’m Sir Topas the priest. I’ve come to visit Malvolio the lunatic.Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, please go find my lady Olivia—Get out, demon! Why are you bothering this poor man! Can’t you talk about anything besides ladies?
(to himself) Well said, Mr. Priest.Sir Topas, nobody’s ever been as badly treated as I’ve been. Good Sir Topas, don’t believe I’m insane, They’ve shut me up here in horrible darkness.You should be ashamed of yourself, Satan, you liar! I’m being gentle with you, because I’m one of those good-hearted people who are polite to the devil himself. You call this house dark?Dark as hell, Sir Topas.But it has bay windows that are as transparent as stone walls, and the upper windows facing south-north are as clear as coal. But you’re still complaining of darkness and a bad view?I’m not insane, Sir Topas. I’m telling you, this house is dark.
