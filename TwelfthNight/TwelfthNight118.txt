Save thee, friend, and thy music. Dost thou live by thy
tabour?
No, sir, I live by the church.Art thou a churchman?No such matter, sir. I do live by the church; for I do live at
my house, and my house doth stand by the church.
So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell
near him, or the church stands by thy tabor, if thy tabor
stand by the church.
You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is but a
cheveril glove to a good wit. How quickly the wrong side
may be turned outward!
Nay, that’s certain. They that dally nicely with words may
quickly make them wanton.
I would therefore my sister had no name, sir.Why, man?#LBSFORGOLDGod bless you, my friend, and your music too. Do you make your living by playing that drum?No, sir, I live by the church.Oh, you’re a clergyman?No, I live by the church because I live in a house, and my house is by the church.You could just as easily say that a king sleeps near a beggar if the beggar lives near him, or that the church is supported by your drum because it “stands by” your drum.You’re right, sir. What a wonderful time to be alive! Sentences can be turned inside out so easily nowadays!That’s true. People who fool around with words too much can make words act like whores—changing all the time, and immoral too.That’s why I wish my sister didn’t have a name, sir.Why, man?
