Excellent good, i' faith.Good, good.
(sings)

What is love? 'Tis not hereafter.

Present mirth hath present laughter.

What’s to come is still unsure.

In delay there lies no plenty.

Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty.

Youth’s a stuff will not endure.
A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.A contagious breath.Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall we
make the welkin dance indeed? Shall we rouse the night owl
in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver? Shall
we do that?
An you love me, let’s do ’t. I am dog at a catch.By 'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.Most certain. Let our catch be “Thou Knave.”“Hold thy peace, thou knave,” knight? I shall be
constrained in ’t to call thee knave, knight.
#LBSFORGOLDThat was excellent, really excellent.Good, very good.
(singing)

What is love? It isn’t in the future. When you’re having fun now, you’re laughing right now. The future’s unsure, and there’s no reason to waste time. Come kiss me while you’re twenty. You won’t be young forever.
A beautiful voice, I swear.His breath stinks.Yes, it stinks very sweetly.If we could listen to him with our noses, we would definitely say he stinks very sweetly. So what do you say, should we sing loud enough to shake the heavens? Should we sing a round to wake up the night owl? Should we do that?Let’s go for it. I’m a very good singer, and can sing rounds like a dogdog = expertdog.Then you’ll be good at catchy tunes. Dogs like to play catch.Absolutely. Let’s dance to “You Jerk.”You mean, “Shut up, you jerk”? That’s the song where the singers call each other jerks, right? So I’ll be forced to call you a jerk, Sir Andrew.
