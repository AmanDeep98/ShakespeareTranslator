Give me. (reads) “Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but
a scurvy fellow.”
Good, and valiant.
(reads) “Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind, why I do
call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for ’t.”
A good note, that keeps you from the blow of the law.
(reads) “Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in my sight
she uses thee kindly. But thou liest in thy throat. That is not
the matter I challenge thee for.”
Very brief, and to exceeding good sense—less.
(reads) “I will waylay thee going home, where if it be thy
chance to kill me—”
Good.
(reads) “Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.”Still you keep o' the windy side of the law. Good.
(reads) “Fare thee well, and God have mercy upon one of
our souls. He may have mercy upon mine, but my hope is
better, and so look to thyself. Thy friend, as thou usest him,
and thy sworn enemy,

#LBSFORGOLDGive it to me. (he reads) “Young man, whatever you are, you’re a real scum bucket.”Nice. Very courageous.
(reading) “Don’t even ask why I call you that, because I won’t give you any explanation.”That’s a good thing to put in—it keeps you from getting in trouble with the law.
(reading) “You come to see the lady Olivia, and she’s kind to you. But you’re a complete liar. That’s not why I’m challenging you to a duel.”Nice and short and full of good sense—or should I say nonsense?
(reading) “I’ll ambush you on your way home, and if you’re lucky enough to kill me—”Good.
(reading) “You’ll be killing me like a common criminal, a mugger.”You still haven’t said anything incriminating. Good.
(reading) “Good luck, and may God have mercy on one of our souls. He may have mercy upon mine. But I have a better chance of surviving, so watch out. Signed, your friend, if you treat him right, and your sworn enemy,    Andrew Aguecheek”
