What a plague means my niece, to take the death of her
brother thus? I am sure care’s an enemy to life.
By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights.
Your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill
hours.
Why, let her except, before excepted.Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits
of order.
Confine? I’ll confine myself no finer than I am. These
clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots
too. An they be not, let them hang themselves in their own
straps.
That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard my lady
talk of it yesterday, and of a foolish knight that you brought
in one night here to be her wooer.
Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?Ay, he.He’s as tall a man as any ’s in Illyria.#LBSFORGOLDWhat’s wrong with my niece? Why is she reacting so strangely to her brother’s death? Grief is bad for people’s health.For God’s sake, Sir Toby, you’ve got to come home earlier at night. My lady Olivia, your niece, disapproves of your late-night partying.Well, she can get used to it.Yes, but you need to keep yourself within the limits of order and decency.Keep myself? The only thing I’m keeping myself in is the clothes I’m wearing. They’re good enough to drink in, and so are these boots. If they aren’t, they can go hang themselves by their own laces!You’re going to destroy yourself with all this drinking. Lady Olivia said so yesterday. She also mentioned some stupid knight you brought in one night as a possible husband for her.Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?Yes, that’s the one.He’s as tall“Tall” could be used as slang for “brave.”tall as a man in Illyria.
