Cesario is your servant’s name, fair princess.My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry worldSince lowly feigning was call’d compliment.You’re servant to the Count Orsino, youth.And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:Your servant’s servant is your servant, madam.For him, I think not on him. For his thoughts,Would they were blanks, rather than fill’d with me.Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughtsOn his behalf.   O, by your leave, I pray you,I bade you never speak again of him.But, would you undertake another suit,I had rather hear you to solicit thatThan music from the spheres.     Dear lady—Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,After the last enchantment you did here,A ring in chase of you. So did I abuseMyself, my servant, and, I fear me, you:Under your hard construction must I sit,To force that on you, in a shameful cunningWhich you knew none of yours. What might you think?#LBSFORGOLDCesario is my name—your servant’s name—fair princess.My servant! The world’s gone downhill since fake humility started passing for compliments. You’re not my servant, young man. You’re Count Orsino’s servant.But he’s your servant, so everything that’s his must be yours too. Your servant’s servant is your servant, madam.As for him, I never think about him. As for his thoughts, I wish he’d think about nothing at all rather than think about me all the time.Madam, I’ve come here to try to make you like him.Oh, please, I’m begging you, don’t mention him again. But if you want to tell me that someone else loves me, I’d enjoy hearing that more than I’d enjoy listening to angels sing.My dear lady—Please let me say something, I’m begging you. After you cast your magic spell on me last time, I sent you a ring. I fear it was a mistake, since I tricked my servant, myself, and you too. You probably think poorly of me after I forced that ring on you with such outrageous trickery. What else could you possibly think of me?
