There is a fair behavior in thee, captain,And though that nature with a beauteous wallDoth oft close in pollution, yet of theeI will believe thou hast a mind that suitsWith this thy fair and outward character.I prithee—and I’ll pay thee bounteously—Conceal me what I am, and be my aidFor such disguise as haply shall becomeThe form of my intent. I’ll serve this duke.Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him.It may be worth thy pains, for I can singAnd speak to him in many sorts of musicThat will allow me very worth his service.What else may hap to time I will commit.Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.Be you his eunuch, and your mute I’ll be.When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.I thank thee. Lead me on.#LBSFORGOLDYou seem to be a good person, captain, and although people who look beautiful are often corrupt inside, I believe that you have a beautiful mind to go with your good looks and manners. Please—and I’ll pay you plenty for this—help me conceal my identity, and find me the right disguise so I can look the way I want. I want to be this Duke’s servant. You’ll introduce me to him as a eunuch. You won’t be wasting your time, because I really can sing and talk to him about many different kinds of music, so he’ll be happy to have me in his service. Only time will tell what will happen after that—just please keep quiet about what I’m trying to do.I won’t say a word. You can be a eunuch, but I’ll be mute. I swear on my life I won’t tell your secret.Thank you. Show me the way.
