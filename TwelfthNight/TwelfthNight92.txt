No pains, sir. I take pleasure in singing, sir.I’ll pay thy pleasure then.Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.Give me now leave to leave thee.Now, the melancholy god protect thee, and the tailor make
thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very
opal. I would have men of such constancy put to sea, that
their business might be everything and their intent
everywhere, for that’s it that always makes a good voyage of
nothing. Farewell.
Let all the rest give place.    Once more, Cesario,Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty.Tell her my love, more noble than the world,Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her,Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;But ’tis that miracle and queen of gemsThat nature pranks her in attracts my soul.But if she cannot love you, sir?#LBSFORGOLDNo trouble, sir. I like singing.Then I’ll pay you for doing what you like.Well, in that case, all right. We all pay for what we like sooner or later.You may leave.I’ll pray for the god of sadness to protect you, sir. And I hope your tailor will make you an outfit out of fabric that changes color, because your mind is like an opal that changes colors constantly. Men as wonderfully changeable as you are should all go drifting on the sea, where they can do whatever comes their way, and go wherever the current takes them. Those are the men whose trips are always successful. Goodbye.All the rest of you can leave too.Cesario, go visit that cruel Olivia one more time. Tell her my love is purer than anything else in the whole world, and has nothing to do with her property. The wealth she’s inherited isn’t what makes me value her. It’s her rich, jewel-like beauty that attracts me.But if she can’t love you, sir?
