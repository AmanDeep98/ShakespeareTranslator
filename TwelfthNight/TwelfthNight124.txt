This fellow is wise enough to play the fool,And to do that well craves a kind of wit.He must observe their mood on whom he jests,The quality of persons, and the time,And, like the haggard, check at every featherThat comes before his eye. This is a practiseAs full of labor as a wise man’s art,For folly that he wisely shows is fit.But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.Save you, gentleman.And you, sir.
Dieu vous garde, monsieur.

Et vous aussi. Votre serviteur!
I hope, sir, you are, and I am yours.Will you encounter the house? My niece is desirous you
should enter, if your trade be to her.
I am bound to your niece, sir. I mean, she is the list of my
voyage.
Taste your legs, sir. Put them to motion.#LBSFORGOLDThis guy’s wise enough to play the fool, and only clever people can do that. He pays attention to the mood and social rank of the person he’s joking with, and also to the time of day. And he doesn’t let go of his target when a distraction appears. His job requires as much effort and skill as any wise man’s occupation could. And he shows he’s very smart at playing the fool, while smart people look stupid when they play the fool.Hello, sir.Hello to you too, sir.
(speaking in French) May God protect you, sir.
(speaking in French) And you too, sir. I’m at your service.(stammeringSir Andrew’s awkwardness reveals that he’s bad at French.stammering) Oh, good, I am too.My niece would like you to come in to the house, if your business here has to do with her.I’m headed for your niece, sir. She’s the reason I’m here.Taste your legs, sir. Please go inside.
