Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.Nay, I’ll come. If I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be
boiled to death with melancholy.
Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally
sheep-biter come by some notable shame?
I would exult, man. You know, he brought me out o' favor
with my lady about a bear-baiting here.
To anger him, we’ll have the bear again, and we will fool
him black and blue. Shall we not, Sir Andrew?
An we do not, it is pity of our lives.Here comes the little villain.How now, my metal of India?Get you all three into the boxtree. Malvolio’s coming down
this walk. He has been yonder i' the sun practising behavior
to his own shadow this half hour. Observe him, for the love
of mockery, for I know this letter will make a contemplative
idiot of him. Close, in the name of jesting!
#LBSFORGOLDCome along with us, Signor Fabian.I’m coming, don’t worry. If I miss this, let me be boiled alive.Won’t you be glad to see that rascal dog humiliated?I’ll be thrilled. You know, he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when I arranged a bear-baiting here.We’ll have another bear-baiting just to make him angry, and we’ll mock him till he’s black and blue. Won’t we, Sir Andrew?If we don’t, it’ll be the biggest disappointment of our lives.Here comes the little villain herself.How are you, my golden girl?Hide behind the boxwood hedge, all three of you. Malvolio’s coming down the path. He’s been over there practicing how to act for the past half hour. Watch him carefully if you want to have some fun, guys. This letter’s going to turn him into a starry-eyed idiot. Now hide, for God’s sake!
