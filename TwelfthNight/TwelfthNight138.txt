We’ll call thee at the cubiculo. Go.This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand strong,
or so.
We shall have a rare letter from him: but you’ll not
deliver ’t?
Never trust me, then. And by all means stir on the youth to
an answer. I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them
together. For Andrew, if he were opened and you find so
much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I’ll eat
the rest of the anatomy.
And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great
presage of cruelty.
Look where the youngest wren of nine comes.If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself into
stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen,
a very renegado. For there is no Christian that means to be
saved by believing rightly can ever believe such impossible
passages of grossness. He’s in yellow stockings.
#LBSFORGOLDWe’ll come find you in the bedroom. Go on.This precious little guy is putty in your hands, Sir Toby.He must like me, since he’s let me spend two thousand of his ducats.His letter’s going to be hilarious. But you’re not going to deliver it, are you?Never trust me again if I don’t. And by all means see if you can get the young man to answer it. I don’t think a team of oxen could get them close enough to fight. If you dissected Andrew and found enough red blood in his liverIt was commonly believed that cowards had white livers with no blood in them.liver for a flea to eat, then I’d eat the rest of his corpse. He’s a coward.And his opponent, the young messenger, doesn’t look like he’d be very aggressive in a fight.Here comes my little bird.Listen, if you want a good laugh—and I mean a side-splitting one—then follow me. That gullible idiot Malvolio must have renounced Christianity, since no Christian could do such outrageous things as he’s doing. He’s wearing yellow stockings.
