Tell him he shall not speak with me.Has been told so, and he says he’ll stand at your door like a
sheriff’s post, and be the supporter to a bench, but he’ll
speak with you.
What kind o' man is he?Why, of mankind.What manner of man?Of very ill manner. He’ll speak with you, will you or no.Of what personage and years is he?Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy,
as a squash is before ’tis a peascod, or a codling when ’tis
almost an apple. 'Tis with him in standing water, between
boy and man. He is very well-favored, and he speaks very
shrewishly. One would think his mother’s milk were scarce
out of him.
Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.Gentlewoman, my lady calls.Give me my veil. Come, throw it o'er my face. (OLIVIA puts
on a veil) We’ll once more hear Orsino’s embassy.
#LBSFORGOLDTell him he’s not going to speak with me.I told him that. He says he’ll stand at your door like a signpost or a bench until he speaks with you.What kind of man is he?Just a man, like any other.But what’s he like?He’s very rude. He insists he’ll speak with you whether you want him to or not.What does he look like? How old is he?Not old enough to be a man, but not young enough to be a boy. He’s like a bud before it becomes a pea pod, or like a little green apple before it gets big and ripe. He’s somewhere between boy and man. He’s very handsome and speaks well, but he’s very young. He looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding.Show him in. Call in my maid.Maria, our lady wants you.Give me my veil. Come, put it over my face. (OLIVIA puts on her veil) We’re going to hear Orsino’s pleas again.
