Who governs here?   A noble duke, in natureAs in name.  What is his name?     Orsino.Orsino. I have heard my father name him.He was a bachelor then.And so is now, or was so very late.For but a month ago I went from hence,And then ’twas fresh in murmur—as, you know,What great ones do the less will prattle of—That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.What’s she?A virtuous maid, the daughter of a countThat died some twelvemonth since, then leaving herIn the protection of his son, her brother,Who shortly also died, for whose dear love,They say, she hath abjured the companyAnd sight of men.   Oh, that I served that ladyAnd might not be delivered to the world,Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,What my estate is.   That were hard to compass,Because she will admit no kind of suit,No, not the duke’s.#LBSFORGOLDWho’s the ruler here?A duke who is noble in name and character.What’s his name?Orsino.Orsino. I’ve heard my father mention him. When I first heard about him, he was still a bachelor.He’s still a bachelor, or at least he was a month ago, when I left. But there was a rumor—you know, people always gossip about royalty—that he was in love with the beautiful Olivia.Who’s she?A virtuous young woman, the daughter of a count who died last year. Her brother had custody of her for a while, but then he died too. They say she’s totally sworn off men now, in memory of her brother.I wish I could work for that lady! It’d be a good way to hide from the world until the time was right to identify myself.That would be hard to do. She won’t allow anyone in to see her, not even the duke’s messengers.
