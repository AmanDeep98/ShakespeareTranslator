'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to call me“knave.” Begin, Fool. It begins “Hold thy peace.”I shall never begin if I hold my peace.Good, i' faith. Come, begin.What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady have not
called up her steward Malvolio and bid him turn you out of
doors, never trust me.
My lady’s a Cataian. We are politicians, Malvolio’s a Peg-
a-Ramsey, and (sings) Three merry men be we.—Am not I
consanguineous? Am I not of her blood? Tillyvally!
“Lady”! (sings) There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady!
Beshrew me, the knight’s in admirable fooling.Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do I too.He does it with a better grace, but I do it more natural.
(sings) O' the twelfth day of December—
For the love o' God, peace!#LBSFORGOLDIt won’t be the first time someone was forced to call me that. You start, Fool. It starts, “Shut up.”I’ll never be able to start if I shut up.That’s true. But come on, start.You’re making a terrible racket out here! Lady Olivia told her servant Malvolio to kick you out of the house. I swear it’s true.Lady Olivia can go to China for all I care. We’re very smart guys, and Malvolio’s Little Bo Peep. (he sings) We’re just having some fun.—Aren’t I her relative, after all? Aren’t we related? Fiddle-dee-dee, “Lady!” (singing) There lived a man in Babylon, lady, lady!
Gosh, the knight’s very good at acting like a fool.Yes, he’s good at it when he’s in the mood, and so am I. He’s practiced more, but it comes more naturally to me.
(he sings) On the twelfth day of December—
For God’s sake, shut up!
