The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I learned from
my entertainment. What I am and what I would are as
secret as maidenhead. To your ears, divinity. To any
other’s, profanation.
Give us the place alone. We will hear this divinity.Now, sir, what is your text?Most sweet lady—A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it. Where
lies your text?
In Orsino’s bosom.In his bosom? In what chapter of his bosom?To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.Oh, I have read it. It is heresy. Have you no more to say?Good madam, let me see your face.Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with
my face? You are now out of your text. But we will draw the
curtain and show you the picture. Look you, sir, such a one
I was this present. Is ’t not well done?
#LBSFORGOLDIf I seemed rude, it’s because of how badly I was treated when I got here. Who I am and what I want are a secret. You’re the only one I can share the secret with. It’s sacred, just for you. It’s not for anyone else to hear.Everyone, please leave us alone for a moment. I’ve got a “sacred” secret to hear.Now, sir, what’s this holy secret you wanted to tell me?Most sweet lady—Oh, “sweet”! It sounds like a nice and gentle kind of faith. Where’s the passage of holy scripture that you’re basing your sermon on?In Orsino’s heart.In his heart? In what chapter and verse of his heart?The table of contents says it’s in the first chapter of his heart.Oh, I’ve read that. That’s not holy, it’s heresy. Do you have anything else to say?Madam, please let me see your face.Has your lord given you any orders to negotiate with my face? I don’t think so. You’re overstepping your bounds now. But I’ll open the curtain and let you see the picture. Look, sir, this is a portrait of me as I am at this particular moment. It’s pretty well done, isn’t it?
