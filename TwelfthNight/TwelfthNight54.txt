In voices well divulged, free, learned, and valiant;And in dimension and the shape of natureA gracious person. But yet I cannot love him;He might have took his answer long ago.If I did love you in my master’s flame,With such a suffering, such a deadly life,In your denial I would find no sense;I would not understand it.   Why, what would you?Make me a willow cabin at your gateAnd call upon my soul within the house.Write loyal cantons of contemned loveAnd sing them loud even in the dead of night.Halloo your name to the reverberate hillsAnd make the babbling gossip of the airCry out “Olivia!” Oh, you should not restBetween the elements of air and earth,But you should pity me.   You might do much.What is your parentage?Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.I am a gentleman.   Get you to your lord.I cannot love him. Let him send no more—Unless perchance you come to me againTo tell me how he takes it. Fare you well.I thank you for your pains. Spend this for me.#LBSFORGOLDBut I just can’t love him. He should have resigned himself to that a long time ago.If I loved you as passionately as my master does, and suffered like he does, your rejection would make no sense to me. I wouldn’t understand it.What would you do about it?I’d build myself a sad little cabin near your house, where my soul’s imprisoned. From that cabin I’d call out to my soul. I’d write sad songs about unrequited love and sing them loudly in the middle of the night. I’d shout your name to the hills and make the air echo with your name, “Olivia!” Oh, you wouldn’t be able to go anywhere without feeling sorry for me.Not bad; you might accomplish something. Who are your parents?I was born to a higher position than I’ve got now. But I’m still fairly high-ranking. I’m a gentleman.Go back to your lord. I can’t love him. Tell him not to send any more messengers—unless you feel like coming back to tell me how he took the bad news. Goodbye. Thanks for your trouble. Here’s some money for you.
