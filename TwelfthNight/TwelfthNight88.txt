   Thou dost speak masterly.My life upon ’t, young though thou art, thine eyeHath stay’d upon some favor that it loves.Hath it not, boy?   A little, by your favor.What kind of woman is’t?   Of your complexion.She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?About your years, my lord.Too old by heaven. Let still the woman takeAn elder than herself. So wears she to him,So sways she level in her husband’s heart.For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,Than women’s are.   I think it well, my lord.Then let thy love be younger than thyself,Or thy affection cannot hold the bent.For women are as roses, whose fair flowerBeing once displayed, doth fall that very hour.And so they are. Alas, that they are so,To die even when they to perfection grow!#LBSFORGOLDYou’re absolutely right. I’d bet my life that, as young as you are, you’ve fallen in love with someone. Haven’t you, boy?A little bit.What kind of woman is she?She’s a lot like you.She’s not good enough for you, then. How old is she?About as old as you are, my lord.That’s definitely too old. A woman should always pick an older man. That way she’ll adjust herself to what her husband wants, and the husband will be happy and faithful to her. Because however much we like to brag, boy, the truth is that we men change our minds a lot more than women do, and our desires come and go a lot faster than theirs.I think you’re right, sir.So find someone younger to love, or you won’t be able to maintain your feelings. Women are like roses: the moment their beauty is in full bloom, it’s about to decay.That’s true. It’s too bad their beauty fades right when it reaches perfection!
