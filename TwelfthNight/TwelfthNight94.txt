I cannot be so answer’d.   Sooth, but you must.Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,Hath for your love a great a pang of heartAs you have for Olivia. You cannot love her.You tell her so. Must she not then be answered?There is no woman’s sidesCan bide the beating of so strong a passionAs love doth give my heart. No woman’s heartSo big, to hold so much. They lack retention.Alas, their love may be called appetite,No motion of the liver, but the palate,That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt;But mine is all as hungry as the sea,And can digest as much. Make no compareBetween that love a woman can bear meAnd that I owe Olivia.   Ay, but I know—What dost thou know?Too well what love women to men may owe.In faith, they are as true of heart as we.My father had a daughter loved a manAs it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,I should your lordship.   And what’s her history?#LBSFORGOLDI refuse to accept that.But you have to. Just imagine some lady might exist who loves you as powerfully and agonizingly as you love Olivia. But you can’t love her, and you tell her so. Shouldn’t she just accept that?No woman is strong enough to put up with the kind of intense passion I feel. No woman’s heart is big enough to hold all my love. Women don’t feel love like that—love is as shallow as appetite for them. It has nothing to do with their hearts, just their sense of taste. They eat too much and get indigestion and nausea. But my love’s different. It’s as all-consuming and insatiable as the sea, and it can swallow as much as the sea can. Don’t compare a woman’s love for a man with my love for Olivia.Yes, but I know—What do you know?I know a lot about the love women can feel for men. Actually, their hearts are as sensitive and loyal as ours are. My father had a daughter who loved a man in the same way that I might love you, if I were a woman.And what’s her story?
