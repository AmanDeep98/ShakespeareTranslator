(aside) I knew ’twas I, for many do call me fool.(seeing the letter) What employment have we here?(aside) Now is the woodcock near the gin.
(aside) O, peace! And the spirit of humors intimate reading
aloud to him!
(picking up the letter) By my life, this is my lady’s hand
these be her very C’s, her U’s and her T’s and thus makes she
her great P’s. It is, in contempt of question, her hand.
(aside) Her C’s, her U’s and her T’s. Why that?
(reads) “To the unknown beloved, this, and my good
wishes”—Her very phrases! By your leave, wax. Soft! And

'Tis my lady. To whom should this be?
(aside) This wins him, liver and all.

(whispering) Her C’s, her U’s, and her T’s. Why focus on that?
(reads) To my dear beloved who doesn’t know I love him, I send you this letter with all my heart”—That’s exactly how she talks! Excuse me, sealing wax. (he breaks the seal) Wait! This is the stamp my lady seals her letters with—it has a picture of Lucrece on it. This letter is from Olivia. Who is this written to?
(whispering) This’ll get him.
(he reads)
God knows I love someone.But who?I can’t let my lips say his name;“No man must know.”
