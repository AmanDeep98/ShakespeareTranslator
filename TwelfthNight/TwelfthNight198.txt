To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou
findest him. I would we were well rid of this knavery. If he
may be conveniently delivered, I would he were, for I am
now so far in offense with my niece that I cannot pursue
with any safety this sport to the upshot. Come by and by to
my chamber.

(sings in his own voice)

   Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,

   Tell me how thy lady does.
Fool!
(sings) My lady is unkind, perdy.
Fool!
(sings) Alas, why is she so?
Fool, I say!
(sings) She loves another—Who calls, ha?
Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand, help
me to a candle, and pen, ink, and paper. As I am a
gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee for ’t.
Master Malvolio?Ay, good fool.#LBSFORGOLDNow talk to him in your own voice, and tell me how he is. I wish this trick would be over. If we can find a convenient way to let him go, I want to do it. I’m in so much trouble with my niece that it wouldn’t be safe to let this prank go to its conclusion. Come to my room later on.
(he sings in his own voice)

   Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,

   Tell me how your lady is.
Fool!
(singing) My lady’s mean, and that’s a fact.
Fool!
(singing) Oh, I’m sorry, why is she mean?
Fool, I say!
(singing) She loves someone else—Who’s shouting?
Good fool, good jester, I’ll make it worth your while if you get me a candle, and a pen, ink and paper. You have my word as a gentleman that I’ll always be grateful to you.Master Malvolio?Yes, good fool.
