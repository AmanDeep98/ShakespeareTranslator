There is example for ’t. The lady of the Strachy married the
yeoman of the wardrobe.
(aside) Fie on him, Jezebel!
(aside) O, peace! Now he’s deeply in. Look how
imagination blows him.
Having been three months married to her, sitting in my
state—
(aside) Oh, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet gown,
having come from a daybed, where I have left Olivia
sleeping—
(aside) Fire and brimstone!(aside) O, peace, peace!And then to have the humor of state, and after a demure
travel of regard, telling them I know my place as I would
they should do theirs, to ask for my kinsman Toby—
(aside) Bolts and shackles!(aside) O peace, peace, peace! Now, now.#LBSFORGOLDAfter all, it wouldn’t be the first time that kind of thing has happened. Lady Strachy married her wardrobe manager.
(whispering) Damn him, the arrogant fool!
(whispering) Shh! We’ve got him right where we want him. He’s on a big ego trip.Just think of me, having been married to her for three months, sitting around majestically—
(whispering) If only I had a slingshot so I could hit him in the eye!Calling my servants together, wearing an embroidered robe, having just come from a couch where I’ve left Olivia sleeping—
(whispering) That does it!
(whispering) Oh, be quiet, be quiet!Then I’d put on a lofty and exalted expression. I’d look around the room calmly, then tell them that I know my place, and I’d like them to know theirs. Then I’d tell them to go find my cousin Toby—
(whispering) That really does it!
(whispering) Oh, quiet, quiet! Please, please.
