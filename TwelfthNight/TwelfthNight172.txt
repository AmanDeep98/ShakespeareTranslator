I shall be much bound to you for ’t. I am one that had rather
go with sir priest than sir knight. I care not who knows so
much of my mettle.
Why, man, he’s a very devil. I have not seen such a firago.
I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he gives
me the stuck-in with such a mortal motion, that it is
inevitable. And on the answer, he pays you as surely as your
feet hit the ground they step on. They say he has been
fencer to the Sophy.
Pox on ’t! I’ll not meddle with him.Ay, but he will not now be pacified. Fabian can scarce hold
him yonder.
Plague on ’t, an I thought he had been valiant and so
cunning in fence, I’d have seen him damned ere I’d have
challenged him. Let him let the matter slip, and I’ll give
him my horse, gray Capilet.
I’ll make the motion. Stand here, make a good show on ’t.This shall end without the perdition of souls. (aside) Marry,I’ll ride your horse as well as I ride you.#LBSFORGOLDI’d be very grateful to you if you did. I’m much more of a religious type than a fighter, and I don’t care who knows it.Wow, he’s a real devil. I’ve never seen such a monster. I had a round with him, and his sword thrust is so deadly that you can’t even duck out of the way. And when he strikes back at you, he’ll hit you as sure as you’re standing there. They say he used to fence for the shah of Persia.That’s it! I won’t mess with him.Yes, but now there’s no way to calm him down. Fabian can hardly control him over there.Darn it, if I’d guessed he was so brave and such a good swordsman, I never would have challenged him. I’ll give him my gray horse Capilet if he forgets the whole thing.I’ll give it a try. Stay right here and try to look good. This may end without anyone getting killed. (to himself) I’ll ride your horse just like I ride you.
