I can write very like my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter
we can hardly make distinction of our hands.
Excellent! I smell a device.I have ’t in my nose too.He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they
come from my niece, and that she’s in love with him.
My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that color.And your horse now would make him an ass.Ass, I doubt not.Oh, ’twill be admirable!Sport royal, I warrant you. I know my physic will work with
him. I will plant you two, and let the fool make a third,
where he shall find the letter. Observe his construction of it.
For this night, to bed, and dream on the event. Farewell.
Good night, Penthesilea.Before me, she’s a good wench.She’s a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me. What o'
that?
I was adored once too.#LBSFORGOLDand I can’t tell the difference between each other’s handwriting.Excellent! Sounds like you’ve got a good trick in mind.I like it too.He’ll think these letters are from Olivia and that she’s in love with him.Yes, that’s the idea.He’s going to look like a total idiot.Absolutely, you idiot.This is going to be great!It’s going to be fun, I promise. I know my medicine will work on him. I’ll have you two hide—and the fool too—right where he’ll find the letter. Watch his reaction. Meanwhile, let’s go to bed and dream about this. Good night.Good night, you amazing woman, you.She’s a fine woman, all right.She’s a good little woman, and she adores me. What about it?Someone adored me once, too.
