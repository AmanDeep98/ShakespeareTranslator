Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow. Let me be clear of
thee.
Well held out, i' faith. No, I do not know you, nor I am not
sent to you by my lady, to bid you come speak with her, nor
your name is not Master Cesario, nor this is not my nose
neither. Nothing that is so is so.
I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else. Thou know’st not
me.
Vent my folly? He has heard that word of some great man
and now applies it to a fool. Vent my folly! I am afraid this
great lubber, the world, will prove a cockney. I prithee now,
ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my
lady. Shall I vent to her that thou art coming?
I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me. There’s money for
thee. (giving money) If you tarry longer, I shall give worse
payment.
By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men that
give fools money get themselves a good report—after
fourteen years' purchase.
#LBSFORGOLDAre you trying to tell me that I wasn’t sent to get you?Oh, who cares, you’re acting like a fool. Leave me alone.Good for you, holding out on me like this! No, I don’t know you, and my lady didn’t send me to get you, and I’m not supposed to tell you to come speak with her, and your name is not Master Cesario, and this is not my nose, either. Nothing is what it is.Oh please, go somewhere else to blab your nonsense. You don’t know me.Blab my nonsense? He must’ve heard that phrase describing some great man and now he’s using it on a jester. Blab my nonsense! What an idiotic place this world is. Now please stop being so strange and tell me what exactly I should blab to my lady. Should I blab to her that you’re coming?Please, fool, go away. Here’s money for you. (giving him money) If you stay any longer, I’ll give you something worse.Well, well. You’re a generous man. Wise men who give fools money might get a good reputation—if they keep up regular payments for fourteen years.
