Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all the devils of
hell be drawn in little, and Legion himself possessed him,
yet I’ll speak to him.
Here he is, here he is. How is’t with you, sir? How is’t with
you, man?
Go off, I discard you. Let me enjoy my private. Go off.
(to SIR TOBY BELCH) Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within
him! Did not I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have
a care of him.
Aha! Does she so?
(to FABIAN and MARIA) Go to, go to! Peace, peace. We must
deal gently with him. Let me alone.—How do you,
Malvolio? How is ’t with you? What, man, defy the devil!
Consider, he’s an enemy to mankind.
Do you know what you say?
(to SIR TOBY BELCH) La you, an you speak ill of the devil,
how he takes it at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!
Carry his water to the wisewoman.Marry, and it shall be done tomorrow morning if I live. My
lady would not lose him for more than I’ll say.
How now, mistress?#LBSFORGOLDWhere is he, for God’s sake? I don’t care if all the devils in hell crammed together to possess him, I still want to speak to him.Here he is, here he is. How are you, sir?Go away. I don’t want to see your face. Let me enjoy my privacy. Go away.
(to SIR TOBY BELCH) Ooh, listen to the scary devil speaking from inside him! Didn’t I tell you? Sir Toby, Lady Olivia wants you to take care of him.Ah-ha! Does she?
(to FABIAN and MARIA) Come on, come on! Calm down, calm down. We need to treat him gently. Let me take care of this.—How are you, Malvolio? How are things? Come on, man, just say no to the devil! Think about it, he’s the enemy of mankind.Do you even know what you’re talking about?
(to SIR TOBY BELCH) Look at that, he acts insulted if you say bad things about the devil! I hope to God he’s not bewitched!Get a urine sample and take it to a witch doctor to find out.Sure thing, we’ll do it tomorrow morning. My lady would never want to lose him.What are you saying, mistress?
