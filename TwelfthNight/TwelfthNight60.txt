Will you stay no longer, nor will you not that I go with you?By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me. The
malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours.
Therefore I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my
evils alone. It were a bad recompense for your love to lay
any of them on you.
Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.No, sooth, sir. My determinate voyage is mere
extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of
modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing
to keep in. Therefore it charges me in manners the rather to
express myself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my
name is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo. My father was
that Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard
of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an
hour. If the heavens had been pleased, would we had so
ended! But you, sir, altered that, for some hour before you
took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned.
Alas the day!#LBSFORGOLDYou won’t stay any longer? And you don’t want me to come with you?No, I’d rather you stayed here. My luck is pretty bad right now, and it might rub off on you. So just let me say goodbye and face the bad stuff alone—otherwise I wouldn’t be thanking you very well for all you’ve done for me.At least tell me where you’re going.Honestly, I can’t. I’m just wandering, with no particular destination. But I know you’d never force me to tell you things I don’t want to, so I should be polite and tell you what I can. My name’s Sebastian, though I’ve been calling myself Roderigo. My father was Sebastian of Messaline. I know you’ve heard of him. He’s dead now. He left behind myself and my twin sister, who was born in the same hour as me. If God had been willing, I wish we had died in the same hour too! But you kept that from happening. An hour before you pulled me out of the breaking waves, my sister drowned.How tragic!
