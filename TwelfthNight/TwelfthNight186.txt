(to SEBASTIAN) Now, sir, have I met you again? There’s for
you.

(returning the blow) Why, there’s for thee, and there, and
there. Are all the people mad?
Hold, sir, or I’ll throw your dagger o'er the house.
(aside) This will I tell my lady straight. I would not be in
some of your coats for two pence.
(seizing SEBASTIAN) Come on, sir, hold!Nay, let him alone. I’ll go another way to work with him. I’ll
have an action of battery against him if there be any law in
Illyria. Though I struck him first, yet it’s no matter for that.

(to SIR TOBY BELCH) Let go thy hand.Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young soldier,
put up your iron. You are well fleshed. Come on.
I will be free from thee.#LBSFORGOLDWell, sir, we meet again? Take that.
(returning the blow) Well, then, take that, and that, and that. Is everyone here insane?Stop right now or I’ll throw your dagger over the roof.
(to himself) I’m going to tell my lady about this right away. I wouldn’t be in any of your shoes if you paid me.
(grabbing SEBASTIAN) Come on, sir, stop!No, leave him alone. I’ll get back at him another way. I’ll sue him for assault and battery, if there’s any justice in Illyria. It doesn’t matter that I hit him first.
(to SIR TOBY BELCH) Let me go.No, sir, I won’t let you go. Come on, put your sword away, my little soldier. You’re awfully eager to fight. Come on.I’ll get free of you.
