I would not by my will have troubled you,But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,I will no further chide you.I could not stay behind you. My desire,More sharp than filèd steel, did spur me forth.And not all love to see you, though so muchAs might have drawn one to a longer voyage,But jealousy what might befall your travel,Being skilless in these parts, which to a stranger,Unguided and unfriended, often proveRough and unhospitable. My willing love,The rather by these arguments of fear,Set forth in your pursuit.   My kind Antonio,I can no other answer make but thanks,And thanks, and ever thanks. And oft good turnsAre shuffled off with such uncurrent pay.But were my worth as is my conscience, firm,You should find better dealing. What’s to do?Shall we go see the relics of this town?Tomorrow, sir. Best first go see your lodging.I am not weary, and ’tis long to night:I pray you, let us satisfy our eyesWith the memorials and the things of fameThat do renown this city.#LBSFORGOLDI really didn’t want to inconvenience you. But since you seem to enjoy helping me, I won’t nag you to stop any more.I couldn’t stay behind after you left. I just felt a sharp desire to follow you. It wasn’t just that I wanted to see you, though I very much did want that. I was also worried about what might happen to you while you were traveling, since you’re not familiar with this area, and it’s rough and unwelcoming to a stranger with no guide. I followed you because I love you and I was worried about you.My friend Antonio, all I can say is thank you. I know words are cheap. If I had any money I’d back up my gratitude with cash. Anyway, what should we do? Should we go see the sights in the town?We can do that tomorrow, sir. First we should make sure you have somewhere to stay.I’m not tired, and night is a long time away. Come on, let’s go see the sights.
