Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?Fool, there was never a man so notoriously abused: I am as
well in my wits, Fool, as thou art.
But as well? Then you are mad indeed, if you be no better
in your wits than a fool.
They have here propertied me, keep me in darkness, send
ministers to me—asses!—and do all they can to face me out
of my wits.
Advise you what you say. The minister is here. (in the voice
of Sir Topas) Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens
restore! Endeavor thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain
bibble-babble.
Sir Topas!
(as Sir Topas) Maintain no words with him, good fellow. (in
his own voice) Who, I, sir? Not I, sir. God b' wi' you, good
Sir Topas. (as Sir Topas) Marry, amen. (in his own voice) I
will, sir, I will.
Fool, fool, fool, I say!Alas, sir, be patient. What say you sir? I am shent for
speaking to you.
Good fool, help me to some light and some paper. I tell
thee, I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.
Well-a-day that you were, sir.#LBSFORGOLDPoor man, how did you go insane?Fool, no one has ever been as mistreated as I am. I’m completely sane, Fool. I’m as sane as you are.As sane as me? Then you really are insane, if you’re no saner than a fool.They treat me like garbage here. They keep me in darkness, and send idiotic priests to talk to me—those asses!—and do everything they can to insist I’m insane.Be careful what you say—the priest is here. (in the voice of Sir Topas) Malvolio, Malvolio, may heaven make you sane again! Try to sleep, and stop your pointless babbling.Sir Topas!
(as Sir Topas) Don’t talk to him, my friend. (in his own voice) Who, me, sir? Not me, sir. God be with you, Sir Topas, goodbye. (as Sir Topas) Well then, amen. (in his own voice) Goodbye, sir.Fool, fool, hey, fool!Please, sir, be quiet. What do you want to say, sir? I’ve just been scolded for speaking to you.Be a nice fool and help me find a candle and some paper. I tell you, I’m as sane as any man in Illyria.If only you were, sir.
