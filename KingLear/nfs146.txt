(giving the GENTLEMAN a purse and a ring) No, there’s no need. To assure you that I am a nobleman in disguise, here is some money. If you see Cordelia—as I’m sure you will—show her this ring. She’ll tell you who I am. Damn this storm! I’ll go find the king.Let me shake your hand. Do you have anything else to tell me?Only a few more words, but they’re the most important.
