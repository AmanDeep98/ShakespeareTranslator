   Good my lord, enter here.Prithee, go in thyself. Seek thine own ease.This tempest will not give me leave to ponderOn things would hurt me more. But I’ll go in.
(to FOOL) In, boy. Go first. You houseless poverty—Nay, get thee in. I’ll pray, and then I’ll sleep.Poor naked wretches, whereso'er you are,That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,Your looped and windowed raggedness, defend youFrom seasons such as these? Oh, I have ta'enToo little care of this! Take physic, pomp.Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,That thou mayst shake the superflux to themAnd show the heavens more just.
(within) Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!Come not in here, nuncle. Here’s a spirit. Help me, help me!Give me thy hand. Who’s there?A spirit, a spirit. He says his name’s Poor Tom.What art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw?Come forth.#LBSFORGOLDMy lord, please go inside here.Go inside yourself. Make yourself comfortable. This storm protects me from thoughts that would hurt me more. But I’ll go in. (to FOOL) You go in first, boy. Oh, you suffering homeless people—No, you go in. I’ll pray first, then I’ll sleep.Poor homeless creatures suffering this storm, wherever you are, how will you survive a night like this with no roof over your heads, no fat on your sides to keep you warm, and only rags for clothes? When I was king I didn’t do enough to help you. Powerful men, take your medicine by learning about hardship. Go out and feel what the impoverished feel. Then you can give them your extra wealth and make the world more fair.
(from inside) The water in here is nine feet deep! Poor Tom!Don’t come in here, uncle! There’s a spirit in here! Help me, help me!Give me your hand. Who’s there?A ghost, a ghost! He says his name’s Poor Tom.Who are you, moaning in the hut like that? Come out.
