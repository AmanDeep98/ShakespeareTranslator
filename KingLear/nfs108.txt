The king his master needs must take it ill,That he, so slightly valued in his messenger,Should have him thus restrained.     I’ll answer that.My sister may receive it much more worseTo have her gentleman abused, assaultedFor following her affairs.—Put in his legs.
(to GLOUCESTER) Come, my good lord, away.I am sorry for thee, friend. 'Tis the duke’s pleasure,Whose disposition, all the world well knows,Will not be rubbed nor stopped. I’ll entreat for thee.Pray you do not, sir. I have watched and traveled hard.Some time I shall sleep out. The rest I’ll whistle.A good man’s fortune may grow out at heels.Give you good morrow.The duke’s to blame in this. 'Twill be ill taken.#LBSFORGOLDof punishment you propose is more suited to petty shoplifters than to royal attendants.The king will be offended to find out that his messenger is so badly treated.I’ll take responsibility for that.My sister would be much more offended to have her trusted messenger abused and assaulted just for carrying out her orders.—Put his legs in the stocks.
(to GLOUCESTER) Let’s go, my lord.I’m sorry, my friend. The duke always gets it his way, and everyone knows you can’t budge him once he’s made up his mind. I’ll try talking to him again.Please don’t, sir. I’ve been up for a long time and have done a lot of traveling recently. This punishment will be a good chance to catch up on my sleep. The rest of the time I’ll whistle to entertain myself. Even good men have bad luck. Have a good morning.It’s wrong for the duke to do this. The king will be angry with him.
