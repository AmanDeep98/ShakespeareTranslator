'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,And not send back my messenger.     As I learned,The night before there was no purpose in themOf this remove.
(to LEAR)    Hail to thee, noble master!Ha! Makest thou this shame thy pastime?     No, my lord.Ha, ha! Look, he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by the
heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by the loins,
and men by the legs. When a man’s overlusty at legs, then
he wears wooden nether-stocks.

(to KENT) What’s he that hath so much thy place mistookTo set thee here?   It is both he and she:Your son and daughter.   No.     Yes.     No, I say.I say “Yea.”#LBSFORGOLDIt’s strange that Regan and her husband left their house without sending back my messenger.According to what I heard, they had no travel plans as of last night.
(to LEAR) Hail, noble master!What’s this? Are you sitting around in this humiliation to amuse yourself?No, my lord.Ha, ha! That’s a nasty garter belt. You tie up horses by their heads, dogs and bears by their necks, monkeys by their waists, and humans by their legs. When a person’s prone to wanderlust, he has to wear wooden socks, like a chastity belt around his ankles.
(to KENT) Who could have misunderstood your assigment so completely as to lock you up like this?Your daughter and son-in-law.No.Yes.I’m telling you “No.”And I’m telling you “Yes.”
