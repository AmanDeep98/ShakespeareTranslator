Before the head has any—The head and he shall louse.So beggars marry many.The man that makes his toeWhat he his heart should makeShall of a corn cry woe,And turn his sleep to wake.For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths   in a glass.No, I will be the pattern of all patience.I will say nothing.Who’s there?Marry, here’s grace and a codpiece—that’s a wise man and

(to LEAR) Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love nightLove not such nights as these. The wrathful skiesGallow the very wanderers of the darkAnd make them keep their caves. Snce I was man,Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,Such groans of roaring wind and rain I neverRemember to have heard. Man’s nature cannot carryTh' affliction nor the fear.   Let the great godsThat keep this dreadful pudder o'er our headsFind out their enemies now.

I won’t say a word.Who’s there?A wise man and a fool.

Any wretched person who has committed secret crimes and escaped justice should tremble in fear now. Better hide now, you murderers, you perjurers, you incest-practicing people who pretend to be virtuous. Tremble and shake, villain, for secretly plotting against human lives. Let all your bottled-up crimes come flooding out at last, as you beg for
