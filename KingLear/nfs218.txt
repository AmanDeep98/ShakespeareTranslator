Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you
the reason?
Something he left imperfect in the state which, since his
coming forth, is thought of; which imports to the kingdom
so much fear and danger that his personal return was most
required and necessary.
Who hath he left behind him general?The Marshal of France, Monsieur la Far.Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of
grief?
Ay, sir. She took them, read them in my presence,And now and then an ample tear trilled downHer delicate cheek. It seemed she was a queenOver her passion, who, most rebel-like,Sought to be king o'er her.   O, then it moved her?Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow stroveWho should express her goodliest. You have seenSunshine and rain at once—her smiles and tearsWere like a better way. Those happy smiletsThat played on her ripe lip seemed not to knowWhat guests were in her eyes, which parted thenceAs pearls from diamonds dropped. In brief,Sorrow would be a rarity most belovedIf all could so become it.#LBSFORGOLDDo you know why the King of France suddenly went back home?He’d left some unfinished business, which he remembered after arriving here. It was urgent and important enough to require his personal presence.Whom did he leave in charge here?The marshal of France, Monsieur la Far.Was Queen Cordelia aggrieved by the letters you delivered?Yes, sir. She took the letters and read them in front of me. Now and then a large tear trickled down her delicate cheek. She seemed to be trying to control her emotions, which were overwhelming her.So she was moved by it?There were no outbursts. She was struggling between emotion and self-control. You’ve seen how it can rain while the sun shines? That’s how she was, smiling and crying at once, only more lovely. The little smile on her full lips didn’t seem aware of the tears that were dropping like diamonds from her pearly eyes. If everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow, then sorrow would be highly prized.
