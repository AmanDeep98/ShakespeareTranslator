I’m concerned about the French because they have invaded our soil, not because they support King Lear or those others—who, I’m afraid, may have legitimate grievances against us.Noble words, sir.Why are we talking about this?We must join forces against the enemy. Our domestic squabbles are not the issue here.Then let’s meet with our senior command and discuss what to do next.I’ll meet you at your tent.Goneril, are you coming with us?
