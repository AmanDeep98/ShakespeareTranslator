Service.Who wouldst thou serve?You.Dost thou know me, fellow?No, sir. But you have that in your countenance which I
would fain call master.
What’s that?Authority.What services canst thou do?I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in
telling it, and deliver a plain message bluntly. That which
ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in. And the best of
me is diligence.
How old art thou?Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to
dote on her for anything. I have years on my back forty-
eight.
Follow me. Thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse after
dinner, I will not part from thee yet.—Dinner, ho, dinner!
Where’s my knave, my fool?—Go you, and call my fool
hither.
#LBSFORGOLDTo work as a servant.Who do you want to work for?You.Do you know me?No, sir, but there’s something about your face that makes me want to serve you.What do you see in my face?Authority.What work can you do?I can be discreet in honorable matters, ride a horse, run, tell a good story badly, and deliver a plain message bluntly. I’m good at everything that ordinary men can do. The best thing about me is that I’m hardworking.How old are you?Not young enough to fall in love with a woman because she sings well, but not old enough to dote on a woman for any reason. I’m forty-eight.Follow me. You’ll work for me. If I still like you after dinner, I won’t send you away yet.—Hey, dinnertime! Dinner! Where’s my fool?—Go call my fool and have him come here.
