(plucks out GLOUCESTER’s other eye)
Where is thy luster now?All dark and comfortless. Where’s my son Edmund?Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of natureTo quit this horrid act.   Out, treacherous villain!Thou call’st on him that hates thee. It was heThat made the overture of thy treasons to us,Who is too good to pity thee.O my follies! Then Edgar was abused.Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smellHis way to Dover.
(to CORNWALL) How is ’t, my lord? How look you?I have received a hurt. Follow me, lady.—Turn out that eyeless villain. Throw this slaveUpon the dunghill.—Regan, I bleed apace.Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.I’ll never care what wickedness I do,If this man come to good.If she live long,And in the end meet the old course of death,Women will all turn monsters.#LBSFORGOLD
(he gouges out GLOUCESTER’s other eye)
Where’s your sparkle now?Nothing but darkness and horror. Where’s my son Edmund? Edmund, let your love for me ignite your bloodlust to avenge this horrible crime!Wrong, evil traitor. You’re appealing to a son who hates you. He was the one who revealed your treason to us. He’s too good to have any compassion for you.What a fool I’ve been! This means I’ve mistreated Edgar. Dear God, forgive me. Let him be well!Kick him out of the gate. He can sniff his way to Dover.
(to CORNWALL) What is it, my lord? Why do you look like that?I’m wounded. Follow me, madam.—Throw the blind traitor outside. And throw this dead peasant into the manure pit.—Regan, I’m bleeding. It’s a bad time for such an injury. Give me your arm.If our criminal master gets off free, I won’t care what happens to me anymore.If she lives a long and happy life, then all women may as well turn into monsters.
