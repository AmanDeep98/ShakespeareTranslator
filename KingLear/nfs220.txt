   Made she no verbal question?Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of “father”Pantingly forth as if it pressed her heart,Cried, “Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies, sisters!Kent, father, sisters! What, i' th' storm, i' th' night?Let pity not be believed.” There she shookThe holy water from her heavenly eyes,And clamor moistened. Then away she startedTo deal with grief alone.   It is the stars,The stars above us, govern our conditions.Else one self mate and mate could not begetSuch different issues. You spoke not with her since?No.Was this before the king returned?     No, since.Well, sir, the poor distressèd Lear’s i' th' town,Who sometime in his better tune remembersWhat we are come about, and by no meansWill yield to see his daughter.     Why, good sir?A sovereign shame so elbows him. His own unkindnessThat stripped her from his benediction turned herTo foreign casualties, gave her dear rightsTo his dog-hearted daughters. These things stingHis mind so venomously that burning shameDetains him from Cordelia.#LBSFORGOLDShe didn’t ask anything?Actually, once or twice she sighed and said, “father,” as if the word were pressing on her chest. Once she exclaimed, “Sisters, sisters, shame on you! Kent, father, sisters! What, out in a storm in the middle of the night? I can’t believe it.” The tears fell from her eyes like holy water. Then she ran away to grieve alone.It must be fate that makes us who we are—otherwise someone as good as Cordelia could not possibly be related to those two witches. Have you not spoken to her since then?No.Did this happen before the King of France returned home?No, afterward.Well, sir, poor delirious Lear is in town. Sometimes when he’s lucid he remembers why we’re here, and absolutely refuses to see his daughter.Why, good sir?He’s too overwhelmed with shame. He remembers how unkind he was to her, how he disowned her and sent her abroad, how he gave her rightful inheritance to her two dog-hearted sisters. All those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from Cordelia.
