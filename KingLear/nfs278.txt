Some officers take them away. Good guardUntil their greater pleasures first be knownThat are to censure them.
(to LEAR)
   We are not the firstWho with best meaning have incurred the worst.For thee, oppressèd King, I am cast down.Myself could else outfrown false fortune’s frown.Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?No, no, no, no! Come, let’s away to prison.We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage.When thou dost ask me blessing, I’ll kneel downAnd ask of thee forgiveness. So we’ll live,And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laughAt gilded butterflies, and hear poor roguesTalk of court news, and we’ll talk with them too—Who loses and who wins, who’s in, who’s out—And take upon ’s the mystery of thingsAs if we were God’s spies. And we’ll wear outIn a walled prison packs and sects of great onesThat ebb and flow by the moon.     Take them away.Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?He that parts us shall bring a brand from heavenAnd fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes.#LBSFORGOLDOfficers, take them away. Guard them carefully until we decide how to punish them.
(to LEAR) At least we’re not the first ones in our position. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. But I’m worried about you, my poor King. If it were only me, I would just wait out my bad luck. Should we meet with my sisters?No, no, no, no! Come on, let’s go to prison. The two of us together will sing like birds in a cage. We will be good to each other. When you ask for my blessing, I’ll get down on my knees and ask you to forgive me. That’s how we’ll live—we’ll pray, we’ll sing, we’ll tell old stories, we’ll laugh at pretentious courtiers, we’ll listen to nasty court gossip, we’ll find out who’s losing and who’s winning, who’s in and who’s out. We’ll think about the mysteries of the universe as if we were God’s spies. In prison we’ll outlast hordes of rulers that will come and go as their fortunes change.Take them away.My Cordelia, even the gods admire how much you’ve sacrificed for me. Have I hugged you yet? Anyone who wants to separate us will have to smoke us out of the cave of our togetherness like foxes. Wipe your eyes.
