(to LEAR) Good my lord, take his offer. Go into the house.I’ll talk a word with this same learnèd Theban.—What is your study?How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.Let me ask you one word in private.
(aside to GLOUCESTER)Importune him once more to go, my lord.His wits begin t' unsettle.     Canst thou blame him?His daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent—He said it would be thus, poor banished man.Thou say’st the king grows mad. I’ll tell thee, friend,I am almost mad myself. I had a son,Now outlawed from my blood. He sought my life,But lately, very late. I loved him, friend—No father his son dearer. Truth to tell thee,#LBSFORGOLD
(to LEAR) Sir, please take him up on his offer and go back with him.I want to chat a bit with this wise GreekIn Shakespeare’s time the Greeks were associated with wisdom and education, especially in philosophy. Important Greek works in philosophy and the sciences had been recently rediscovered after centuries of oblivion.Greek man.—What kind of philosophy do you study?How to keep the devil away and kill rats.Let me ask you something in private.
(speaking so that only GLOUCESTER can hear) Ask him again to return with you, my lord. He’s beginning to lose his mind.Can you blame him?His daughters want to kill him. Ah, good old Kent said this would happen—that poor, banished man. You say the king is losing his mind. Let me tell you, my friend, I’m almost insane myself. I had a son, whom I’ve legally disowned. He tried to kill me recently, very recently. I loved him, as much as any father ever loved his son. To tell you the truth, I’m crazed with grief.
