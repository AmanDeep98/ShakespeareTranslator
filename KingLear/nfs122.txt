“Informed them”? Dost thou understand me, man?Ay, my good lord.The king would speak with Cornwall. The dear fatherWould with his daughter speak, commands, tends service.Are they “informed” of this? My breath and blood!“Fiery”? The “fiery” duke? Tell the hot duke that Lear—No, but not yet. Maybe he is not well.Infirmity doth still neglect all officeWhereto our health is bound. We are not ourselvesWhen nature, being oppressed, commands the mindTo suffer with the body. I’ll forbear,And am fallen out with my more headier willTo take the indisposed and sickly fitFor the sound man.
(notices KENT again)
   Death on my state! WhereforeShould he sit here? This act persuades meThat this remotion of the duke and herIs practice only. Give me my servant forth.Go tell the duke and ’s wife I’d speak with them—Now, presently. Bid them come forth and hear me,Or at their chamber door I’ll beat the drumTill it cry sleep to death.   I would have all well betwixt you.O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down.#LBSFORGOLD“Informed them”? Do you understand what I’m saying, man?Yes, my lord.The king wants to speak with Cornwall. The father wants to speak with his daughter. He orders them—he begs them. Did you inform them of that? This is unbelievable! “Passionate”? The “passionate” duke? Tell the hot-headed duke that I… But no, not yet. Maybe he’s not feeling well. When we’re ill we can’t carry out our duties as well as when we’re healthy. When our bodies are out of order, our minds can’t function properly. I’ll hold off, and subdue my impulsive temper, which makes me judge a sick man as if he were well. (he notices KENT again) A curse on my royal power! Why should he sit here like this? The fact that they punished him convinces me that Regan and the duke are avoiding me on purpose. I want my servant released. Go tell the duke and his wife I’ll speak to them right now, at once. Tell them to come here and hear me out, or else I’ll beat a drum at their bedroom door until they can’t sleep any more.I just want everything to be all right between you.Oh, my heart, my heart is rising into my throat! Stay down, heart.
