Why art thou angry?That such a slave as this should wear a sword,Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwainWhich are too intrinse t' unloose, smooth every passionThat in the natures of their lords rebel,Bring oil to fire, snow to the colder moods;Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaksWith every gale and vary of their masters,Knowing naught, like dogs, but following.—A plague upon your epileptic visage!Smile you my speeches as I were a fool?Goose, an I had you upon Sarum plain,I’d drive ye cackling home to Camelot.Why, art thou mad, old fellow?
(to KENT)      How fell you out?Say that.No contraries hold more antipathyThan I and such a knave.Why dost thou call him “knave”? What’s his offense?His countenance likes me not.No more perchance does mine, nor his, nor hers.Sir, ’tis my occupation to be plain.I have seen better faces in my timeThan stands on any shoulder that I seeBefore me at this instant.#LBSFORGOLDWhy are you enraged?I’m angry that a dishonorable lowlife like this wears a sword like a gentleman. Smiling swindlers such as he undo the sacred bonds that unite people together, and only encourage the unreasonable passions of their masters. They foster both rage and apathy. They say “Yes” and “No,” turning their noses whichever way the wind blows without taking a firm stance on anything. They blindly follow their masters' impulses, like dogs.—Damn your ugly stinking face! Are you laughing at what I say, as if I were a fool? If I had my way with you right now, I’d send you to back to where you came from.Are you insane, old man?
(to KENT) What did you start quarreling over? Just tell us.I couldn’t hate that jerk over there any more than I do.Why are you calling him a jerk? What did he do to you?I don’t like his face.But maybe you don’t like mine, or his, or hers either.I’m used to telling the truth, sir, and I have to say that I’ve seen better faces than those I see here.
