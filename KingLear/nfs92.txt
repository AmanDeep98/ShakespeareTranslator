If it be true, all vengeance comes too shortWhich can pursue th' offender. How dost, my lord?O madam, my old heart is cracked, it’s cracked.What, did my father’s godson seek your life?—He whom my father named, your Edgar?O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid.Was he not companion with the riotous knightsThat tend upon my father?I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad, too bad.Yes, madam, he was of that consort.No marvel then, though he were ill affected.'Tis they have put him on the old man’s death,To have th' expense and spoil of his revenues.I have this present evening from my sisterBeen well informed of them—and with such cautionsThat if they come to sojourn at my houseI’ll not be there.   Nor I, assure thee, Regan.—Edmund, I hear that you have shown your fatherA childlike office.   It was my duty, sir.He did bewray his practice, and receivedThis hurt you see striving to apprehend him.Is he pursued?#LBSFORGOLDIf they’re true, no punishment is harsh enough for the criminal. How are you, my lord?Oh, madam, my old heart is broken, broken.Did my father’s godson try to kill you?

They probably put him up to killing old man Gloucester to get his money. Tonight I received a letter from my sister telling me all about them—and warning me not be at home in case they come to stay at my house.And I won’t be there either.—Edmund, I’m told you’ve acted like a true son to your father.I just did my duty, sir.He exposed Edgar’s murderous plot, and was wounded, as you see there, when trying to apprehend him.Are your men searching for him?
