O thou good Kent, how shall I live and workTo match thy goodness? My life will be too short,And every measure fail me.To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.All my reports go with the modest truth,Nor more, nor clipped, but so.     Be better suited.These weeds are memories of those worser hours.I prithee, put them off.   Pardon, dear madam.Yet to be known shortens my made intent.My boon I make it that you know me notTill time and I think meet.   Then be ’t so, my good lord.—How does the king?   Madam, sleeps still.     O you kind gods,Cure this great breach in his abusèd nature,Th' untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up,Of this child-changèd father!     So please your majestyThat we may wake the king? He hath slept long.#LBSFORGOLDOh, Kent, what could I ever do to become as good as you are? I won’t live long enough, and all my efforts will fail me.Just being thanked is more than enough for me, madam. I hope all reports about me simply tell the truth, no more or less.Change into better clothes. These rags will just remind us of those bad times when you had to wear a disguise. Please take them off.I’m sorry, madam, but I can’t do that yet. If people recognize me now, I won’t be able to carry out my plans. I have to ask you, as a favor, not to let on that you recognize me until the time is right.All right, my lord.—How’s the king doing?He’s still sleeping, ma'am.Kind gods, heal the wounds that he’s wrongly suffered! Restore the sanity of this father whose children have driven him mad and changed him into a child again!Would you mind if we woke up the king? He’s slept a long time.
