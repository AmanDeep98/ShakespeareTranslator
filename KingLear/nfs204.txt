     How should this be?Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,Angering itself and others.—Bless thee, master!Is that the naked fellow?   Ay, my lord.Then prithee, get thee gone. If for my sakeThou wilt o'ertake us hence a mile or twainI' th' way toward Dover, do it for ancient love.And bring some covering for this naked soul,Which I’ll entreat to lead me.     Alack, sir, he is mad.'Tis the time’s plague when madmen lead the blind.Do as I bid thee. Or rather, do thy pleasure.Above the rest, be gone.I’ll bring him the best 'parel that I have,Come on ’t what will.   Sirrah, naked fellow—Poor Tom’s a-cold.
(aside) I cannot daub it further.Come hither, fellow.
(aside) And yet I must.—Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.Know’st thou the way to Dover?#LBSFORGOLD
(to himself) What’s going on? I hate pretending I’m a wandering beggar when all I want to do now is comfort my poor father.—Bless you, master.Is that the naked guy?Yes, my lord.
(to the OLD MAN) Then please go. If you’re willing to do me a favor, as an old friend, then catch up to us a mile or two further on the way to Dover, and bring some clothes for this poor beggar. I’ll ask him to be my guide.But sir, he’s crazy.It’s the tragedy of our times that lunatics must lead the blind. Do as I asked you. Or rather, do what you feel like doing. But above all, get out of here.I’ll bring the crazy beggar the best clothes I have, no matter what happens.Hey, naked guy—Poor Tom’s chilly. (to himself) I can’t play this role any longer.Come here, man.
(to himself) But I must.—Bless you, sir. Your dear eyes are bleeding.Do you know the way to Dover?
