If but as well I other accents borrow,That can my speech diffuse, my good intentMay carry through itself to that full issueFor which I razed my likeness. Now, banished Kent,If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned,So may it come thy master, whom thou lovest,Shall find thee full of labors.Let me not stay a jot for dinner. Go get it ready.
(to KENT) How now, what art thou?A man, sir.What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?I do profess to be no less than I seem—to serve him truly
that will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, to
converse with him that is wise and says little, to fear
judgment, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish.
What art thou?A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.If thou beest as poor for a subject as he’s for a king, thou'rt
poor enough. What wouldst thou?
#LBSFORGOLDIf I can disguise my voice as well as my appearance, then I’ll be able to carry out my plan perfectly. I was banished, but hopefully I can serve the very king who condemned me. I love my master, and he’ll find me very hard-working.Don’t make me wait for dinner even a moment. Get it ready immediately.
(to KENT) Well now, who are you?A man, sir.What’s your profession? What do you want from me?
IKent interprets “your profession” as “your declaration” rather than “your job.”I profess that I’m as good as I seem—I’ll faithfully serve a master who trusts me, love those who are honest, talk with those who are wise and don’t talk too much. I’m God-fearing, I fight if I must, and I don’t eat fish.But who are you?An honest guy who’s as poor as the king.If you’re as poor a subject as he is a king, you definitely are poor. What do you want?
