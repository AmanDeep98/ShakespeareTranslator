Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one
that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!
What a brazen-faced varlet art thou to deny thou knowest
me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up thy heels and beat
thee before the king? Draw, you rogue, for though it be
night yet the moon shines. I’ll make a sop o' th' moonshine
of you. (draws his sword) Draw, you whoreson cullionly
barber-monger, draw!
Away! I have nothing to do with thee.Draw, you rascal. You come with letters against the king
and take Vanity the puppet’s part against the royalty of her
father. Draw, you rogue, or I’ll so carbonado your shanks.
Draw, you rascal! Come your ways.
Help, ho! Murder! Help!Strike, you slave. Stand, rogue. Stand, you neat slave,
strike! (strikes OSWALD)
Help, ho! Murder, murder!How now? What’s the matter? Part.
(to EDMUND) With you, goodman boy, if you please. Come,I’ll flesh ye. Come on, young master.#LBSFORGOLDWhat an ogre you are to slander someone you don’t know, and who doesn’t know you!What a shameless jerk you are to pretend you don’t know me! It was just two days ago that I tripped you and beat you up in front of the king. Draw your sword, scoundrel. It may be nighttime, but there’s enough moonlight to fight by. I’ll make ground beef out of you. (he draws his sword) Draw, you affected, preening son of a bitch! Draw your sword!Get away from me! I’ve got nothing to do with you.Draw your sword, you jerk! You come here with letters against the king, and you take his conceited daughter’s side against his royal highness. Draw your sword, scoundrel, or I’ll slice your thighs like flank steak. Draw your sword! Come on!Help! Murderer! Help!Fight, peasant. Don’t run away, scoundrel. Stand and fight, you overdressed servant, fight! (he hits OSWALD)
Help! Murder, murder!What’s going on here? Get away from each other.
(to EDMUND) Well, kid, let’s see you fight. Come on, I’ll show you how.
