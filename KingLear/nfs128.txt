(rising)     Never, Regan.She hath abated me of half my train,Looked black upon me, struck me with her tongue,Most serpentlike, upon the very heart.All the stored vengeances of heaven fallOn her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,You taking airs, with lameness!     Fie, sir, fie!You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flamesInto her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,You fen-sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun,To fall and blister!   O the blessed gods!So will you wish on me when the rash mood is on.No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.Thy tender-hafted nature shall not giveThee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce, but thineDo comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in theeTo grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,And in conclusion to oppose the boltAgainst my coming in. Thou better know’stThe offices of nature, bond of childhood,Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude.Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot,Wherein I thee endowed.   Good sir, to the purpose.Who put my man i' th' stocks?#LBSFORGOLD
(getting up) Never, Regan. She’s sent away half my knights, glared at me, and aimed her venomous insults straight at my heart. She and her ingratitude can go to hell! I hope she gets sick and becomes lame!Shush, sir, please!I hope lightning strikes her in the eyes! I hope poisonous swampy fog covers her face and ruins her complexion!Oh, dear gods! That’s how you’ll talk about me when you’re in this mood.No, Regan. I’ll never curse you. You’re so gentle, you’d never be harsh like her. Her eyes are vicious, but yours are comforting. You’d never deny me my pleasures, downsize my entourage, insult me thoughtlessly, reduce my allowance, or lock me out of the house. You know better than she does how important the duties of a child to a parent are, and the responsibilities that come from gratitude. You haven’t forgotten the half of a kingdom I gave you.Sir, let’s get to the point.Who put my messenger in the stocks?
