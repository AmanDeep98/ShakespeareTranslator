I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hopeYou less know how to value her desertThan she to scant her duty.     Say, how is that?I cannot think my sister in the leastWould fail her obligation. If, sir, perchanceShe have restrained the riots of your followers,'Tis on such ground and to such wholesome endAs clears her from all blame.My curses on her!O sir, you are old.Nature in you stands on the very vergeOf his confine. You should be ruled and ledBy some discretion that discerns your stateBetter than you yourself. Therefore I pray youThat to our sister you do make return.Say you have wronged her, sir.     Ask her forgiveness?Do you but mark how this becomes the house?—
(kneels) “Dear daughter, I confess that I am old.Age is unnecessary. On my knees I begThat you’ll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.”Good sir, no more. These are unsightly tricks.Return you to my sister.#LBSFORGOLDCalm down, sir, please. I hope there’s been a misunderstanding. It’s more likely that you don’t know how to appreciate her than that she’d ever fail in her duties as a daughter.How do you mean?I can’t believe my sister would neglect her obligations in any way. If she restrained your rowdy knights, she had such a good reason that you can’t blame her for it.I curse her.Sir, you’re old. Your life is stretched to its limit. You should let others take care of you and submit to people who know better than you do what’s good for you. Please go back to Goneril’s house. Admit you were wrong.Apologize? Do you think this kind of thing is appropriate for the royal family? (he kneels) “Dear daughter, I admit I’m old. Old people are useless. I’m begging you, on my knees, to give me food, clothes, and a bed.”No more, please. These are ugly antics. Go back to my sister’s.
