Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception. I have
perceived a most faint neglect of late, which I have rather
blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretense and purpose of unkindness. I will look further
into ’t. But where’s my fool? I have not seen him this two days.
Since my young lady’s going into France, sir, the fool hath
much pined away.
No more of that. I have noted it well. Go you and tell my
daughter I would speak with her.
Go you, call hither my fool.O you sir, you, come you hither, sir. Who am I, sir?My lady’s father.“My lady’s father”? My lord’s knave, your whoreson dog!You slave, you cur!I am none of these, my lord. I beseech your pardon.Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?

I’ll not be strucken, my lord.

Nor tripped neither, you base football player.#LBSFORGOLDNo, you’re just reminding me of something I’ve also noticed. I’ve felt neglected recently, but I decided that it was more likely that I was being hypersensitive than that they were intentionally unkind. I’ll look into it further. But where’s my fool? I haven’t seen him for two days.Ever since Cordelia left for France, sir, the fool has been depressed.Let’s not talk about it. I’ve noticed it myself. Go and tell my daughter I want to speak with her.And you, go call my fool.You there, sir, come here please. Who am I, sir?The father of the lady of the house, sir.“The father of the lady of the house”? You scoundrel! You lowlife son-of-a-bitch! You dog, you peasant!I’m sorry, sir, but I’m not any of those things.Are you making faces at me, you scoundrel? (he hits OSWALD)
I won’t be hit, my lord.
