But are my brother’s powers set forth?     Ay, madam.Himself in person there?Madam, with much ado.Your sister is the better soldier.Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?No, madam.What might import my sister’s letter to him?I know not, lady.Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.It was great ignorance, Gloucester’s eyes being out,To let him live. Where he arrives he movesAll hearts against us. Edmund I think is goneIn pity of his misery to dispatchHis nighted life; moreover to descryThe strength o' th' enemy.I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.Our troops set forth tomorrow. Stay with us.The ways are dangerous.#LBSFORGOLDHave my brother-in-law’s troops been mobilized?Yes, ma'am.Is he there in person?Yes, making a big fuss. Your sister’s the better soldier of the two.Lord Edmund didn’t speak to your master at home?No, ma'am.What could my sister’s letter to him say?I don’t know, ma'am.He rushed away on serious business. It was a huge mistake to let old Gloucester live after we blinded him. Wherever he goes, he inspires compassion and people turn against us. I think Edmund went off to kill him, to put him out of his blind misery. And also to find out the size of the enemy army.I have to follow him and give him the letter.Our troops are deployed tomorrow. Stay with us tonight. It’s dangerous out there.
