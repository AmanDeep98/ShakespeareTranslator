Good King, that must approve the common saw,Thou out of heaven’s benediction comestTo the warm sun.
(takes out a letter)
Approach, thou beacon to this underglobe,That by thy comfortable beams I mayPeruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miraclesBut misery. I know ’tis from Cordelia,Who hath most fortunately been informedOf my obscurèd course and (reads the letter) “shall find timeFrom this enormous state, seeking to giveLosses their remedies.” All weary and o'erwatched,Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to beholdThis shameful lodging.Fortune, good night. Smile once more. Turn thy wheel.

#LBSFORGOLDOh, good King Lear, you’re proving that, just as they say, everything goes from good to bad. (he takes out a letter) Rise and shine, sun, so I can read this letter. Only those who are truly miserable see miracles. I know this letter is from Cordelia, who knows that I’m serving the king in disguise. (looking at the letter) She says that she will have time, now that she’s away from the monstrous conditions here, to find a way to fix things. I’m exhausted. I’ve been awake too long. This fatigue gives me an excuse to shut my eyes so I can’t see myself humiliated in the stocks. Good night, Lady Luck. Smile and spin your wheel of fortune again. (he sleeps)
