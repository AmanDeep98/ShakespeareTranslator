(to KENT, giving him letters) Go you before to Gloucester
with these letters. Acquaint my daughter no further with
anything you know than comes from her demand out of the
letter. If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore
you.
I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your letter.If a man’s brains were in ’s heels, were ’t not in danger of
kibes?
Ay, boy.Then, I prithee, be merry. Thy wit shall ne'er go slipshod.Ha, ha, ha!Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly. For
though she’s as like this as a crab’s like an apple, yet I can tell
what I can tell.
Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?She will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. Thou canst
tell why one’s nose stands i' th' middle on ’s face?

(to KENT, giving him letters) Go ahead of us and deliver these letters to the Earl of Gloucester. Answer my daughter’s questions about the letter, but don’t tell her anything else you know. If you’re not quick enough, I’ll get there before you.I won’t sleep until I’ve delivered your letter, my lord.If a man’s brain were in his feet, wouldn’t it be susceptible to frostbite?Yes, boy.In that case, cheer up. Your brains won’t need slippers to protect them from frostbite, since your brains aren’t in your feet—if they were you wouldn’t take this useless journey to see Regan.Ha, ha, ha!Your other daughter Regan will treat you kindly, you’ll see. Even though she’s as similar to Goneril as one crabapple is like another, still… I know what I know.And what do you know, boy?I know that Regan will taste just like Goneril—both of them sour crabapples. Do you know why the nose is in the middle of a person’s face?
