O cruel! O you gods!One side will mock another—th' other too.If you see vengeance—Hold your hand, my lord!I have served you ever since I was a child.But better service have I never done youThan now to bid you hold.   How now, you dog?If you did wear a beard upon your chin,I’d shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?My villein!Nay then, come on, and take the chance of anger.
(to another servant)
Give me thy sword.—A peasant stand up thus?
(takes a sword, runs at FIRST SERVANT behind, and kills him)
Oh, I am slain!—My lord, you have one eye leftTo see some mischief on him. Oh!
(dies)
Lest it see more, prevent it.—Out, vile jelly!#LBSFORGOLDOh, so cruel! Oh dear gods!Now he’s a little crooked. Gouge out the other eye too.If you see vengeance—Stop, my lord! I’ve served you since childhood, but I’ve never done you a better service than telling you to stop.What’s this, you dog?I am willing to fight you if I must. What do you mean by all this?My peasant, acting like this?Come on then. Over my dead body.
(to another servant) Give me your sword.—A lowly peasant defying his lord like this?
She takes a sword and stabs the FIRST SERVANT from behind, killing him.
I am dying!—My lord, you still have one eye left to see Cornwall punished. Oh!(he dies)
We’ll just have to stop him from seeing ever again. Out, vile jelly, pop out of your eye sockets!
