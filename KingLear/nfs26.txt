'Tis the infirmity of his age. Yet he hath ever but slenderly
known himself.
The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash. Then

imperfections of long-engrafted condition, but therewithal
the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years
bring with them.
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this
of Kent’s banishment.
There is further compliment of leave-taking between
France and him. Pray you, let’s sit together. If our father
carry authority with such dispositions as he bears, this last

We shall further think on ’t.We must do something, and i' th' heat.#LBSFORGOLDHe’s going senile. But then again he’s never really understood his own feelings very well.Yes, he was hotheaded even in the prime of his life. Now that he’s old, we can expect to have to deal not only with his old character flaws, which have turned into deep-rooted habits, but also with the uncontrollable crabbiness that comes with old age.We’ll probably witness many more outbursts from him, like banishing Kent.There’s still the King of France’s farewell ceremony. Let’s put our heads together. If our father continues to use his authority as usual, then his recent abdication of the kingdom will just hurt us.We’ll have to think about it carefully.We have to strike while the iron’s hot.
