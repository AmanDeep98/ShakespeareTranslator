What news?O my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall’s dead,Slain by his servant, going to put outThe other eye of Gloucester.     Gloucester’s eyes?A servant that he bred, thrilled with remorse,Opposed against the act, bending his swordTo his great master; who thereat enragedFlew on him and amongst them felled him dead—But not without that harmful stroke, which sinceHath plucked him after.   This shows you are above,You justicers, that these our nether crimesSo speedily can venge! But oh, poor Gloucester—Lost he his other eye?   Both, both, my lord.—This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer.'Tis from your sister.

   One way I like this well.But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,May all the building in my fancy pluckUpon my hateful life. Another wayThe news is not so tart.—I’ll read and answer.#LBSFORGOLDWhat news do you bring?Oh my lord, the Duke of Cornwall’s dead. He was killed by his servant as he about to gouge out Glouces-ter’s other eye.Gloucester’s eyes?A servant Gloucester had raised in his house, full of compunction, opposed the blinding and turned his sword on the Duke of Cornwall. Enraged, Cornwall attacked and killed the servant, but not without receiving his own wound, of which he later died.There’s justice in heaven after all! That these crimes are punished so quickly is proof. But oh, poor Glou-cester! Did he lose his other eye?He lost both, my lord.—Ma'am, this letter is from your sister, and needs an immediate answer.
(to herself) In a way I’m glad to hear that Cornwall is dead. But on the other hand, Edmund is traveling with Regan, who is now a widow. If something happens between them on the road, it would shatter my hopes of having Edmund for myself and escaping this hateful life. Still, there are benefits to having Cornwall out of the way.—I’ll read this letter and answer it.
