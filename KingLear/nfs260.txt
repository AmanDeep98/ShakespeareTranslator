Be governed by your knowledge, and proceedI' th' sway of your own will. Is he arrayed?Ay, madam. In the heaviness of his sleepWe put fresh garments on him.Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.I doubt not of his temperance.     Very well.Please you, draw near.—Louder the music there!
(kisses LEAR) O my dear father, restoration hangThy medicine on my lips, and let this kissRepair those violent harms that my two sistersHave in thy reverence made!     Kind and dear princess!Had you not been their father, these white flakesDid challenge pity of them. Was this a faceTo be opposed against the warring winds?To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunderIn the most terrible and nimble strokeOf quick cross lightning? To watch—poor perdu!—With this thin helm? Mine enemy’s meanest dog,Though he had bit me, should have stood that nightAgainst my fire. And wast thou fain, poor father,To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlornIn short and musty straw? Alack, alack!'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at onceHad not concluded all.—He wakes. Speak to him.#LBSFORGOLDDo whatever you think best. Is he in his royal garments?Yes, ma'am. We changed his clothes while he was fast asleep.Stay close by when we wake him up, ma'am. I’m sure he will stay under control.All right.Please come closer.— Make the music louder, please!
(kisses LEAR) Oh, my dear father, please get better. May my kiss heal the wounds inflicted on you by my sisters—who should have respected and cherished you.Kind and dear princess!If you hadn’t been their father, your white hair would have inspired in them only compassion. Is this a face that should have endured the freezing winds or withstood the dreadful thunder or the terrible lightning? To stay awake all night like a guardsman—poor lost soul!—with only your thinning hair for a helmet? I would’ve let even my enemy’s nastiest dog stay inside by the fireplace on that night, even if he had bit me. And were you then happy to find shelter on a bed of hay along with swine and homeless bums? Oh, oh! It’s a wonder you didn’t lose your life and your mind all at once.—He’s waking up. Talk to him.
