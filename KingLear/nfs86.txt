My father watches. O sir, fly this place.Intelligence is given where you are hid.You have now the good advantage of the night.Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall aught?He’s coming hither—now, i' th' night, i' th' haste,And Regan with him. Have you nothing saidUpon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?Advise yourself.   I am sure on ’t, not a word.I hear my father coming. Pardon me.In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.Draw. Seem to defend yourself. Now quit you well.—
(loudly) Yield! Come before my father. Light, ho! Here!
(aside to Edgar) Fly, brother, fly.
(loudly)
      Torches, torches!
(aside to Edgar) So, farewell.Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion.Of my more fierce endeavor.
(cuts his own arm)
     I have seen drunkardsDo more than this in sport.—Father, father!—Stop, stop!—No help?Now Edmund, where’s the villain?#LBSFORGOLDFather is on the lookout. Get out of here quickly! It has leaked out that you’re hiding here. If you leave now, you can take advantage of the darkness and sneak away. You haven’t said anything against the Duke of Cornwall, have you? He’s rushing on his way here right now, and Regan’s with him. Have you said anything against Cornwall or Albany? Think about it.I’m sure of it. I haven’t said a word.I hear my father coming. Forgive me. I have to pretend to threaten you with my sword. Draw your sword too, as if you’re defending yourself. Be convincing. (loudly) Give up! Go see my father.—Bring in some light!(speaking so that only EDGAR can hear) Run, brother. (loudly) Torches, bring in the torches! (speaking so that only EDGAR can hear) Goodbye, then.If I had some blood on me it would look like I’d fought more fiercely. (he cuts his own arm) I’ve seen drunk men do worse than this just fooling around.—Father, father!—Stop, stop!—Won’t anyone help me?Edmund, where’s your wicked brother?
