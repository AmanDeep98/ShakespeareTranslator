Who’s there, besides foul weather?One minded like the weather, most unquietly.I know you. Where’s the king?Contending with the fretful elements.Bids the winds blow the earth into the seaOr swell the curlèd water 'bove the main,That things might change or cease. Tears his white hair,Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,Catch in their fury and make nothing of.Strives in his little world of man to outscornThe to-and-fro–conflicting wind and rain.This night—wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,The lion and the belly-pinchèd wolfKeep their fur dry—unbonneted he runs,And bids what will take all.   But who is with him?None but the fool, who labors to outjestHis heart-struck injuries.#LBSFORGOLDWho’s there, aside from this foul weather?Someone whose mood is as foul as the weather, very troubled.I know you. Where’s the king?Struggling with the wind and rain. He’s shouting at the wind to blow the earth into the sea, or make the sea flood the earth—he wants to see the world return to primal chaos. He keeps tearing out his white hair, which the blindly raging winds catch up and blow away into nothingness. Small but brave in his surroundings, he’s trying to stand up against the wind and rain blowing back and forth. He’s running bareheaded, calling for the end of the world, out there on a night like this, when even savage animals ravenous with hunger crawl under cover and hide.But who’s with him?Nobody but the fool, who’s trying to soothe the wounds in the king’s heart with jokes.
