Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantleSo many folds of favor. Sure, her offenseMust be of such unnatural degreeThat monsters it (or your fore-vouched affectionFall into taint), which to believe of herMust be a faith that reason without miracleCould never plant in me.
(to LEAR) I yet beseech your majesty,If for I want that glib and oily artTo speak and purpose not—since what I well intend,I’ll do ’t before I speak—that you make knownIt is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,No unchaste action or dishonored stepThat hath deprived me of your grace and favor,But even for want of that for which I am richer:A still-soliciting eye and such a tongueAs I am glad I have not, though not to have itHath lost me in your liking.     Go to, go to. Better thouHadst not been born than not t' have pleased me better.Is it no more but this—a tardiness in natureWhich often leaves the history unspokeThat it intends to do?—My lord of Burgundy,What say you to the lady? Love’s not loveWhen it is mingled with regards that standsAloof from th' entire point. Will you have her?She is herself a dowry.
(to LEAR)    Royal King,Give but that portion which yourself proposed,And here I take Cordelia by the hand,Duchess of Burgundy.#LBSFORGOLDhatred. Her crime must be extreme and monstrous, or else your earlier love for her wasn’t as true as it seemed. But it’d take a miracle to make me believe she could do anything that horrible.
(to LEAR) Please, your majesty, I don’t have a glib way with words and I only say what I mean. If I decide to do something, then I do it instead of talking about it. So I beg your majesty to let people know that it wasn’t because I did something atrociousthat I fell from your favor. I didn’t murder or commit any immoral or lustful act. I’m out of favor simply because I’m not a fortune-hunter and I don’t have a smooth way with words—and I’m a better person because of it, even though it has cost me your love.Enough. It would’ve been better for you not to have been born at all than to displease me as you did.You mean this is the whole problem, that she is shy and hasn’t said everything she means to say and do?—My lord of Burgundy, what do you have to say to this lady? Love’s not love when it gets mixed up with irrelevant outside matters. Will you marry her? She herself is as valuable as any dowry could ever be.
(to LEAR) King, just give me the dowry you promised me, and I’ll make Cordelia the Duchess of Burgundy right away.
