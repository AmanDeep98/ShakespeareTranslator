The traitor?Ingrateful fox, ’tis he.   Bind fast his corky arms.What mean your graces? Good my friends, considerYou are my guests. Do me no foul play, friends.Bind him, I say.#LBSFORGOLDPrepare the horses for your lady.Goodbye, my sweet lord.—Goodbye, my sister.Goodbye, Edmund.Go find the traitor Gloucester. Tie him up like a thief and bring him here to me.I can’t condemn him to death without a formal trial, but I’m powerful enough that I can still do something to express my anger. Some men may blame me for doing this, but they won’t be able to do anything about it.—Who’s there? Is that the traitor?Ungrateful traitor! That’s him.Tie up his withered old arms.What are you doing? My friends, remember that you’re my guests here. Don’t play any nasty tricks on me.Tie him up, I tell you.
