Some villain hath done me wrong.That’s my fear. I pray you, have a continent forbearance till
the speed of his rage goes slower. And as I say, retire with
me to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear
my lord speak. Pray ye, go. There’s my key. If you do stir
abroad, go armed.
Armed, brother?Brother, I advise you to the best. Go armed. I am no honest
man if there be any good meaning towards you. I have told
you what I have seen and heard—but faintly, nothing like
the image and horror of it. Pray you, away.
Shall I hear from you anon?I do serve you in this business.A credulous father, and a brother noble—Whose nature is so far from doing harmsThat he suspects none, on whose foolish honestyMy practices ride easy. I see the business.Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit.All with me’s meet that I can fashion fit.#LBSFORGOLDSome villain has told lies about me.That’s what I’m afraid of. I suggest you lay low until his rage cools a little. In the meantime, come home with me, and when the time is right I’ll take you to talk to him. Please go. Here’s my key. If you go outside, arm yourself.Arm myself?Brother, I’m giving you good advice. Arm yourself. I’d be a liar if I told you nobody wanted to hurt you. I’ve told you what I’ve seen and heard, but I’ve toned it down a lot. I’ve spared you you the full extent of the horror that threatens you. Now please go.Will I hear from you soon?I’ll help you through this business.A gullible father and a brother who’s so innocent that he can’t suspect anyone else of wanting to hurt him—these are the two fools I need for my plan to work. I know exactly how to proceed. If I can’t have an estate by birthright, then I’ll get it by being clever. Any trick that works is good for me.
