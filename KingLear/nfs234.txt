Diminished to her cock, her cock a buoyAlmost too small for sight. The murmuring surgeThat on th' unnumbered idle pebbles chafesCannot be heard so high. I’ll look no moreLest my brain turn and the deficient sightTopple down headlong.Set me where you stand.Give me your hand. You are now within a footOf th' extreme verge. For all beneath the moonWould I not leap upright.   Let go my hand.
(gives EDGAR another purse)
Here, friend, ’s another purse, in it a jewelWell worth a poor man’s taking. Fairies and godsProsper it with thee! Go thou farther off.Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.Now fare you well, good sir.   With all my heart.
(aside) Why I do trifle thus with his despairIs done to cure it.   O you mighty gods, (kneels)
This world I do renounce, and in your sightsShake patiently my great affliction off.If I could bear it longer and not fallTo quarrel with your great opposeless wills,My snuff and loathèd part of nature shouldBurn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!—Now, fellow, fare thee well. (falls)
#LBSFORGOLDthan its lifeboat, and its lifeboat looks as small as a tiny buoy. Up here you can’t even hear the waves crashing against the rocks. I have to stop looking, or my head will start spinning and I’ll fall.Lead me to where you’re standing.Give me your hand. You’re now within a foot of the cliff’s edge. I wouldn’t try to jump up and down here for anything on earth.Let go of my hand. (he gives EDGAR another purse) Here’s another purse, my friend. Inside it there’s a jewel that any poor man would be happy to have. I hope it’s only the beginning of future prosperity for you. Now go further away. Say goodbye to me, and let me hear your footsteps as you walk away.Goodbye, good sir.With all my heart.
(to himself) I’m toying with his despair to cure him of it.Oh, you mighty gods! (he kneels) I hereby renounce this world and all my troubles and torments. If I could bear them better, and not fight against your unstoppable decisions, then I would simply wait until I expired naturally. If Edgar’s alive, bless him, gods!—Now, man, goodbye. (he falls)
