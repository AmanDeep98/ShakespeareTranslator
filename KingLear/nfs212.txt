Could my good brother suffer you to do it—A man, a prince by him so benefited?If that the heavens do not their visible spiritsSend quickly down to tame these vile offenses,It will come:Humanity must perforce prey on itselfLike monsters of the deep.   Milk-livered manThat bear’st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs—Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerningThine honor from thy suffering; that not know’stFools do those villains pity who are punishedEre they have done their mischief. Where’s thy drum?France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,With plumèd helm thy state begins to threat,Whiles thou, a moral fool, sits still and cries,“Alack, why does he so?”   See thyself, devil!Proper deformity shows not in the fiendSo horrid as in woman.   O vain fool!Thou changèd and self-covered thing, for shame!Bemonster not thy feature. Were ’t my fitnessTo let these hands obey my blood,They are apt enough to dislocate and tearThy flesh and bones. Howe'er thou art a fiend,A woman’s shape doth shield thee.Marry, your manhood, mew!#LBSFORGOLDking gave half his kingdom—have allowed you to do it? If the heavens don’t punish these crimes immediately, the end will come. Human beings will become cannibals, like ravenous sea fishes.Coward! You take everything lying down, you just turn the other cheek—you can’t even see the difference between being honored and being taken advantage of! If we punish criminalsBy “criminals,” Goneril may be referring to Gloucester, Lear, Cordelia, or all three.criminals before they have a chance to commit their crimes, you’re a fool to pity them. Why aren’t you preparing for war? The French have invaded our peaceful country. Your territory is at risk, and all you can do is sit around like a preachy fool and whine, “Ah, why is he doing that?”Look at yourself, devilish shrew! A woman deformed by hatred and rage is more horrifying than the devil!—at least the devil is supposed to look that way.You useless fool!Shame on you, warped hag! Your true demonic features are distorting your body. If I let myself do what I yearn to, I’d rip the flesh off your bones. But I won’t attack a woman, even if she is a demon.I sneeze on your manhood. Ha!
