Here, father, take the shadow of this treeFor your good host. Pray that the right may thrive.If ever I return to you again,I’ll bring you comfort.   Grace go with you, sir.Away, old man. Give me thy hand. Away!King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en.Give me thy hand. Come on.No further, sir. A man may rot even here.What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endureTheir going hence even as their coming hither.Ripeness is all. Come on.   And that’s true too.#LBSFORGOLDHere, father, rest awhile in the shade of this tree. Say a little prayer for our side in battle. If I ever come back, I’ll bring you good news.Good luck, sir.We have to get out of here, old man. Let me help you up. Let’s go! King Lear’s been defeated. He and his daughter are captured. Give me your hand. Come on.I can’t go any further, sir. This is as good a place as any to die.Are you depressed again? You can’t choose your time of death any more than your time of birth. We live and die when our time comes. Come on.And that’s true too.
