Why no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing.
(to KENT) Prithee, tell him so much the rent of his land
comes to. He will not believe a fool.
A bitter fool.Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter
fool and a sweet fool?
No, lad. Teach me.That lord that counseled theeTo give away thy land,Come place him here by me.Do thou for him stand.The sweet and bitter foolWill presently appear—The one in motley here,The other found out there.Dost thou call me fool, boy?All thy other titles thou hast given away that thou wast born
with.
This is not altogether fool, my lord.No, faith, lords and great men will not let me. If I had a
monopoly out, they would have part on ’t. And ladies too—
they will not let me have all fool to myself; they’ll be
snatching. Give me an egg, nuncle, and I’ll give thee two
crowns.
#LBSFORGOLDWhy, no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing.
(to KENT) Please tell him that his income is nothing, now that he’s given his lands away. He won’t believe a fool.You’re a bitter fool.Do you know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and a sweet one?No, son. Tell me.Bring hereThe gentleman who advised youTo give away your land.You can stand in his place.The sweet and bitter foolWill appear right away.The sweet fool in a fool’s costume—that’s me.The bitter one is the other one—that’s you.LEARAre you calling me a fool, boy?Well, you’ve given away all your other rightful titles. The title of “fool” is the only one left.This isn’t entirely a joke, your highness.No. I wish I could be a complete joker—but so many lords and important men are also playing fools that I can’t have a monopoly on it. Ladies too—they’re always snatching away my role as the biggest fool.—Uncle, give me an egg, and I’ll give you two crowns.
