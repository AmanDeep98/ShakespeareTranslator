     What trumpet’s that?I know ’t—my sister’s. This approves her letterThat she would soon be here. (to OSWALD)
Is your lady come?This is a slave whose easy borrowed prideDwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.—Out, varlet, from my sight!   What means your grace?Who stocked my servant? Regan, I have good hopeThou didst not know on ’t.—Who comes here? O heavens,If you do love old men, if your sweet swayAllow obedience, if yourselves are old,Make it your cause. Send down, and take my part!
(to GONERIL) Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?—O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?Why not by th' hand, sir? How have I offended?All’s not offense that indiscretion findsAnd dotage terms so.   O sides, you are too tough.Will you yet hold?—How came my man i' th' stocks?#LBSFORGOLDWhat’s that trumpet?I know it. It’s my sister’s. She’ll be here soon, just like her letter said. (to OSWALD) Has my sister arrived?This is a lowlife who basks in the reflection of the fading glory of the woman he works for.—Get out of my sight, scoundrel!What do you mean, your highness?Who put my servant in the stocks? Regan, I hope you didn’t know anything about that.—Ah, who’s this? Dear gods, if you love old men like me, if you believe in obedience, if you yourselves are old, then please send me down some help! (to GONERIL) Aren’t you ashamed to look at me after the way you’ve treated me in my old age?—Oh, Regan, are you taking her by the hand?Why shouldn’t she take my hand, father? How exactly have I offended you? Just because a senile man with poor judgment calls something an insult doesn’t necessarily mean it is one.Oh, how can the sides of my body hold in my grieving heart?—How did my messenger wind up in the stocks?
