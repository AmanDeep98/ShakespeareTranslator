   Whither is he going?He calls to horse, but will I know not whither.'Tis best to give him way. He leads himself.
(to GLOUCESTER) My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.Alack, the night comes on, and the high windsDo sorely ruffle. For many miles aboutThere’s scarce a bush.   O sir, to wilful men,The injuries that they themselves procureMust be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.He is attended with a desperate train.And what they may incense him to, being aptTo have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.Shut up your doors, my lord. 'Tis a wild night.My Regan counsels well. Come out o' th' storm.#LBSFORGOLDWhere’s he going?He has called for his horse, but I don’t know where he’s headed.It’s best just to let him go. He won’t listen to anyone’s advice.
(to GLOUCESTER) My lord, don’t try to persuade him to stay.Ah, but it’s getting dark, and the winds are strong and stormy. There’s hardly a bush for miles around. He’ll have no shelter.Oh, sir, impetuous people learn their lessons from the consequences of their foolish actions. Lock the doors. His attendants are desperate, violent men. I’m afraid of what they might encourage him to do, considering the state he’s in.Lock the doors, my lord. It’s a wild night. Regan gives good advice. Come in out of the storm.
