Why, my boy?If I gave them all my living, I’d keep my coxcombs myself.There’s mine. Beg another of thy daughters.Take heed, sirrah—the whip.Truth’s a dog that must to kennel. He must be whipped out,
when Lady Brach may stand by th' fire and stink.
A pestilent gall to me!Sirrah, I’ll teach thee a speech.Do.Mark it, nuncle.Have more than thou showest,Speak less than thou knowest,Lend less than thou owest,Ride more than thou goest,Learn more than thou trowest,Set less than thou throwest,Leave thy drink and thy whoreAnd keep in-a-door,And thou shalt have moreThan two tens to a score.This is nothing, Fool.Then ’tis like the breath of an unfee’d lawyer. You gave me
nothing for ’t.—Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?
#LBSFORGOLDWhy, my boy?If I gave them all I own, I’d have two fool’s caps for myself. Here’s mine. Ask your daughters for another one.Watch out, boy—remember I can whip you.I get whipped like a dog for telling the truth, while Lady Bitch gets to stand around the fire and stink the place up with her false words.A constant pain to me!I’ll recite something for you, guy.Yes, do that.Listen up, uncle.Have more than you show,Speak less than you know,Lend less than you owe.Ride more than you walk,Don’t believe everything you hear,Don’t bet everything on one throw of the dice,Leave behind your booze and your whore,And stay indoors,And you’ll end up with moreThan two tens to a twenty.That makes no sense, Fool. It’s nothing.In that case it’s like the words of an unpaid lawyer. You paid me nothing for it. Can’t you make any use of nothing, uncle?
