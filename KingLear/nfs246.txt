If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.I know thee well enough. Thy name is Gloucester.Thou must be patient. We came crying hither.Thou know’st the first time that we smell the airWe wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark me.Alack, alack the day!When we are born, we cry that we are comeTo this great stage of fools. This a good block.It were a delicate stratagem to shoeA troop of horse with felt. I’ll put ’t in proof.And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!Oh, here he is. Lay hand upon him.—Sir,Your most dear daughter—No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am evenThe natural fool of fortune. Use me well.You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons.I am cut to th' brains.   You shall have anything.No seconds? All myself?Why, this would make a man a man of salt,To use his eyes for garden water-pots,Ay, and laying autumn’s dust.     Good sir—#LBSFORGOLDIf you want to cry over my bad luck, I’ll give you my eyes. I know you. Your name’s Gloucester. You have to be patient with me. I came here crying. The first time we see the world as newborns, we cry and scream. I’ll read you a sermon. Listen to this.Oh, how awful!When we’re born, we cry because we’ve arrived on the stage of life, like all the other fools. That’s a nice hat you’ve got there. How ingenious to make horseshoes out of felt. I’ll test it out. And when I’ve sneaked up on my sons-in-law, then I’ll kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
(noticing LEAR) Oh, here he is. Grab him.—Sir, your most dear daughter—What, I’m a prisoner? No rescue for me? My luck has always been bad. Treat me well. There’s a ransom. I need a doctor. My brains are injured.You can have anything you want.Will no one back me up? Am I all alone? That would make anyone cry enough to water his garden with his tears.Good sir—
