   Hard, hard.—O filthy traitor!Unmerciful lady as you are, I’m none.To this chair bind him.—Villain, thou shalt find—By the kind gods, ’tis most ignobly doneTo pluck me by the beard.So white, and such a traitor?Naughty lady,These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chinWill quicken and accuse thee. I am your host.With robbers' hands my hospitable favorsYou should not ruffle thus. What will you do?Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?Be simple-answered, for we know the truth.And what confederacy have you with the traitorsLate footed in the kingdom?     To whose handsYou have sent the lunatic king. Speak.I have a letter guessingly set down,Which came from one that’s of a neutral heart,And not from one opposed.   Cunning.#LBSFORGOLDTie him up harder.—You filthy traitor!I’m not a traitor, unfair lady.Tie him to this chair.—You’ll see, criminal—By the gods, it’s disgraceful for you to pull my beard.As old and white-haired as you are, and you’re such a traitor?Wicked woman, these white hairs you’re pulling off my chin will come to life and accuse you of wrong-doing. You are my guests. This is no way to treat a host who has welcomed you into his house. What do you think you’re doing?Tell us about the letters that you got from France.Get to the point, since we already know the truth.And what’s your connection with the traitors who landed in our kingdom recently?The ones you’ve sent our lunatic king to. Tell us.I got a letter that made some guesses about what was going on, without any proof. It came from a neutral party, not from someone opposed to you.How clever of you.
