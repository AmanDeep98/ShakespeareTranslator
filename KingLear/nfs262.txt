Madam, do you. 'Tis fittest.How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave.Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am boundUpon a wheel of fire, that mine own tearsDo scald like molten lead.   Sir, do you know me?You are a spirit, I know. Where did you die?
(aside to DOCTOR) Still, still far wide!He’s scarce awake. Let him alone awhile.Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?I am mightily abused. I should ev'n die with pityTo see another thus. I know not what to say.I will not swear these are my hands. Let’s see.I feel this pinprick. Would I were assuredOf my condition.

   O, look upon me, sir,And hold your hands in benediction o'er me.No, sir, you must not kneel.     Pray, do not mock me.I am a very foolish fond old man,Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less.And to deal plainlyI fear I am not in my perfect mind.Methinks I should know you, and know this man.#LBSFORGOLDYou talk to him, ma'am. That’s most appropriate.How are you, my royal lord? How is your majesty doing?You do me wrong by taking me out of the grave. You’re a soul in heaven, but I’m tied to the fiery wheel of a torture machine in hell. Even my tears burn me like molten lead.Sir, do you know who I am?You’re a spirit, I know. Where did you die?
(whispering to the DOCTOR) He’s still in outer space.He’s still half asleep. Let him be for a bit.Where have I been? Where am I? Is it daytime? I’ve been tricked. I would die of pity to see someone else in my condition. I don’t know what to say. I can’t even be sure these are my hands. Let’s see. I feel this pinprick. I wish I knew what is happening.
(kneeling) Look at me, sir, and give me your blessing. No, sir, don’t kneel.Please don’t make fun of me. I’m a foolish, senile old man, eighty-something years old, not an hour more or less. To put it plainly, I’m afraid I’m not quite sane. I feel I should recognize you and that man (he points to KENT),
