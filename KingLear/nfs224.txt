Alack, ’tis he. Why, he was met even nowAs mad as the vexed sea, singing aloud,Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,With burdocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,Darnel, and all the idle weeds that growIn our sustaining corn.—A century send forth.Search every acre in the high-grown field,And bring him to our eye.   What can man’s wisdomIn the restoring his bereavèd sense?He that helps him take all my outward worth.There is means, madam.Our foster nurse of nature is repose,The which he lacks—that to provoke in himAre many simples operative, whose powerWill close the eye of anguish.   All blessed secrets,All you unpublished virtues of the earth,Spring with my tears. Be aidant and remediateIn the good man’s distress. Seek, seek for him,Lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the lifeThat wants the means to lead it.     News, madam.The British powers are marching hitherward.#LBSFORGOLDSadly, it’s the king that’s missing. They saw him just now as mad and deranged as the stormy sea, singing loudly, wearing a crown of nettles, thorns, hemlock, and all the other weeds that grow in our cornfields.—Send out a hundred soldiers to find him. Search high and low, in every acre of the fields, and bring him here for me to see him.What can human knowledge do to make him sane again? I’d give all my wealth to whoever can help him.There is a way, ma'am. Nature heals people with rest, which Lear hasn’t had. But there are many herbs that will help him rest and take his mind off his anguish for a while.Then I’ll water all those precious herbs with my tears to make them grow. May they relieve a sick old man’s suffering. Go find those herbs for him, before his madness puts his life in danger.I have news, ma'am. The British forces are on their way here.
