You, you, sirrah, where’s my daughter?So please you—What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.Where’s my fool, ho? I think the world’s asleep.How now? Where’s that mongrel?He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.Why came not the slave back to me when I called him.Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner he would not.He would not?My lord, I know not what the matter is, but to my judgment
your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious
affection as you were wont. There’s a great abatement of
kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the
duke himself also, and your daughter.
Ha! Sayest thou so?I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken—for my
duty cannot be silent when I think your highness wronged.
#LBSFORGOLDYou, sir, where’s my daughter?I beg your pardon, sir—What did that guy say? Call the numbskull back in here.Where’s my fool? You’d think everyone was asleep. So what’s going on? Where’s that dog?He says your daughter’s not feeling well, my lord.Why didn’t the jerk come back to me when I called him?Sir, he told me quite bluntly that he didn’t feel like it.Didn’t feel like it?My lord, I don’t know what’s going on, but it seems to me that your highness isn’t being treated as politely as before. The servants, the duke, and your daughter all seem to be treating you less kindly.Huh! Do you really mean that?Please forgive me if I’m mistaken, my lord—but I can’t keep quiet when I think you’re being insulted.
