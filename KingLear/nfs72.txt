And cast you, with the waters that you loose,To temper clay. Yea, is ’t come to this?Ha? Let it be so. I have another daughter,Who I am sure is kind and comfortable.When she shall hear this of thee, with her nailsShe’ll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt findThat I’ll resume the shape which thou dost thinkI have cast off for ever. Thou shalt, I warrant thee.Do you mark that, my lord?I cannot be so partial, Goneril,To the great love I bear you—     Pray you, content.Come, sire, no more.—What, Oswald, ho!
(to FOOL) You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry and take the fool with thee.A fox when one has caught herAnd such a daughterShould sure to the slaughter,If my cap would buy a halter.So the fool follows after.This man hath had good counsel—a hundred knights!'Tis politic and safe to let him keepAt point a hundred knights, yes, that on every dream,Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,He may enguard his dotage with their powersAnd hold our lives in mercy?—Oswald, I say!#LBSFORGOLDshe hears what you’ve done to me, she’ll tear up your wolflike face with her fingernails. And then you’ll see that despite what you thought, I’ll be as powerful as I was before. You’ll see, I promise you.Did you hear that?Goneril, you know how much I love you, but still I have to say—Shush, please. Come, sir, no more.—Oswald, come here! (to FOOL) And you, sir, you’re more of a rascal than a fool. Go follow your master.Uncle Lear, uncle Lear, wait. Take your fool with you.A fox you’ve trappedAnd such a daughterShould both be slaughtered,If my fool’s cap is worth a rope to bind them.So the fool follows you.My father can’t think straight—a hundred knights! Just imagine the risk we run in letting him keep a hundred knights around! He could use them to strong-arm us into bowing to every little whim of his, and keep us at his mercy.—Oswald, where are you?
