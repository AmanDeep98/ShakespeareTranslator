By his authority I will proclaim itThat he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,Bringing the murderous coward to the stake.He that conceals him, death.When I dissuaded him from his intent,And found him pight to do it, with cursed speechI threatened to discover him. He replied,“Thou unpossessing bastard! Dost thou thinkIf I would stand against thee, would the reposalOf any trust, virtue, or worth in theeMake thy words faithed? No. What I should deny—As this I would, ay, though thou didst produceMy very character—I’d turn it allTo thy suggestion, plot, and damnèd practice.And thou must make a dullard of the world,If they not thought the profits of my deathWere very pregnant and potential spiritsTo make thee seek it.”   O strange and fastened villain!Would he deny his letter, said he? I never got him.—Hark, the duke’s trumpets. I know not why he comes.All ports I’ll bar. The villain shall not ’scape.The duke must grant me that. Besides, his pictureI will send far and near, that all the kingdomMay have the due note of him.—And of my land,Loyal and natural boy, I’ll work the meansTo make thee capable.How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither,Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.#LBSFORGOLDjustice will be rewarded. Whoever helps Edgar hide will die.After I urged him not to kill you, I saw that he was still determined to do it. Enraged, I threatened to expose him. He answered, “You penniless bastard! Do you really think that if it came down to my word against yours, anyone would believe you? No. I’d deny whatever evidence you had against me—even if it were in my own handwriting—and turn it all into evidence against you and your plans for treachery. And you must think people are stupid if you believe they wouldn’t realize all the motives you have for trying to kill me.”Oh, how monstrously evil! He said he would deny that he wrote his letter? He cannot truly be my son.—Listen. The duke’s trumpets. I don’t know why he’s come here. I’ll forbid all ships from leaving our harbors. The villain won’t escape. The duke will agree with me on that. And I’ll send his picture everywhere so that the whole kingdom will know what he looks like.—And as for you, my loyal and true son, I’ll find some way to make you my heir.How are you, my friend? Ever since I arrived here, just now, I’ve been hearing strange rumors.
