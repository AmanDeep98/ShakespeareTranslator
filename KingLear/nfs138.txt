I will have such revenges on you bothThat all the world shall—I will do such things—What they are yet I know not, but they shall beThe terrors of the earth. You think I’ll weep?No, I’ll not weep.I have full cause of weeping, but this heartShall break into a hundred thousand flaws,Or ere I’ll weep.—O Fool, I shall go mad!Let us withdraw. 'Twill be a storm.This house is little. The old man and his peopleCannot be well bestowed.'Tis his own blame. Hath put himself from rest,And must needs taste his folly.For his particular I’ll receive him gladly,But not one follower.   So am I purposed.Where is my lord of Gloucester?Followed the old man forth. He is returned.The king is in high rage.#LBSFORGOLD man’s cheeks. No, you monstrous hags, I’ll get revenge on you both that will make the whole world… I will do such things—I don’t know what I’ll do exactly, but it’ll be devastating. You expect me to cry? Well, I won’t.I have a good reason to cry, but my heart will splinter into a hundred thousand pieces before I let myself cry.—Oh, Fool, I’ll go mad!Let’s go inside. There’s going to be a storm.This is a small house. There’s no room for the old man and his followers.It’s his fault that he’s all worked up like this. He has to pay the price for his foolish actions.I’ll be happy to keep him in my house, but not a single knight.That’s what I intend to do too. Where is Gloucester?He followed the old man. Here he comes back.The king is enraged.
