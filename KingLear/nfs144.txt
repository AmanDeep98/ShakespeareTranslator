   Sir, I do know you,And dare upon the warrant of my noteCommend a dear thing to you. There is division,Although as yet the face of it be coveredWith mutual cunning, ’twixt Albany and Cornwall,Who have—as who have not that their great starsThroned and set high?—servants, who seem no less,Which are to France the spies and speculationsIntelligent of our state. What hath been seen,Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,Or the hard rein which both of them hath borneAgainst the old kind king, or something deeper,Whereof perchance these are but furnishings—But true it is. From France there comes a powerInto this scattered kingdom, who already,Wise in our negligence, have secret feetIn some of our best ports and are at pointTo show their open banner. Now to you.If on my credit you dare build so farTo make your speed to Dover, you shall findSome that will thank you, making just reportOf how unnatural and bemadding sorrowThe king hath cause to plain.I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,And from some knowledge and assurance offerThis office to you.I will talk further with you.#LBSFORGOLDSir, I know you, and I trust you enough to share something very important with you. There’s a feud between Albany and Cornwall, although they’ve been clever enough to hide it thus far. Like other powerful rulers, they have servants who are actually French spies in disguise. These spies have noticed something, perhaps in the squabbles between Albany and Cornwall, or in the tough line both of them have taken against the good old king, or perhaps in some deeper matter at the root of both of these problems—The point is that the King of France has sent troops into our divided kingdom. Some French agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war. Now this is where you come in. If you trust me enough to hurry to Dover, you’ll earn the gratitude of many people when you fairly report the monstrous and maddening extent of the king’s suffering. I’m a nobleman, and I know what I’m doing in assigning this job to you.Let’s discuss it some more.
