Weapons, arms? What’s the matter here?Keep peace, upon your lives.He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?The messengers from our sister and the king.What is your difference? Speak.I am scarce in breath, my lord.No marvel, you have so bestirred your valor. You cowardly
rascal, nature disclaims in thee. A tailor made thee.
Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a man?Ay, a tailor, sir. A stone-cutter or painter could not have
made him so ill though they had been but two years o' th'
trade.
Speak yet. How grew your quarrel?This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared at suit of
his gray beard—
Thou whoreson zed, thou unnecessary letter!—My lord, if
you will give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain into
mortar and daub the wall of a jakes with him.—Spare my
gray beard, you wagtail?
Peace, sirrah!You beastly knave, know you no reverence?Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.#LBSFORGOLDYou have weapons? What’s going on here?Stop it, I order you. The next person to strike again dies. What’s going on here?These are the messengers from my sister and the king.What are you fighting about? Tell me.I’m out of breath, sir.No wonder, with all your exertions, you cowardly rascal. You’re not worth being called a man. The only thing manly about you are your clothes. A tailor made you.That’s an odd thing to say. How can a tailor make a person?Definitely a tailor, sir. A sculptor or a painter couldn’t have screwed him up as bad as that, even as an apprentice.But tell me what you’re fighting about.This old ruffian here, whom I didn’t kill because he’s so old—You useless bastard—you’re like the letter “z,” a totally unnecessary addition to the alphabet.—My lord, please let me grind this lumpy lowlife into a powder and use it to plaster up the bathroom walls.—You didn’t kill me because I’m so old, you fawning dog?Calm down. Don’t you have any manners, you savage?Yes, sir, but not when I’m enraged.
