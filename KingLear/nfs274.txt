The enemy’s in view. Draw up your powers.
(gives ALBANY a document)
Here is the guess of their true strength and forcesBy diligent discovery, but your hasteIs now urged on you.   We will greet the time.To both these sisters have I sworn my love,Each jealous of the other as the stungAre of the adder. Which of them shall I take?Both? One? Or neither? Neither can be enjoyedIf both remain alive. To take the widowExasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril,And hardly shall I carry out my side,Her husband being alive. Now, then, we’ll useHis countenance for the battle, which being done,Let her who would be rid of him deviseHis speedy taking off. As for the mercyWhich he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,The battle done and they within our power,Shall never see his pardon, for my stateStands on me to defend, not to debate.#LBSFORGOLDThe enemy’s in sight. Prepare your troops. (gives ALBANY a document) The reconnaissance operation has returned this estimate of the enemy’s manpower and weaponry. But now, please hurry.We’ll be ready when the time comes.I’ve sworn my love to both of these sisters. They’re jealous of each other like poisonous snakes. Which one of them should I pick? Both? One? Neither? I can’t enjoy either of them as long as the other one’s alive. Goneril would go crazy if I chose Regan, but it would be hard to get in with Goneril while her husband’s still alive. I’ll use Albany’s power and authority for now to win the war, but afterward one of the sisters—whichever one wants to—can get rid of him. Albany wants to spare Lear and Cordelia, but once they are my prisoners after the battle, they won’t stay alive long enough to see his pardon. I have to defend my position with actions, not words.
