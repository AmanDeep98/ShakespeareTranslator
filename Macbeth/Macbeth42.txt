     How
                                now! What news?He has almost supped. Why have you left the chamber?Hath he asked for me?     Know
                                you not he has?We will proceed no further in this business.He hath honored me of late, and I have boughtGolden opinions from all sorts of people,Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,Not cast aside so soon.     Was
                                the hope drunkWherein you dressed yourself? Hath it slept since?And wakes it now, to look so green and paleAt what it did so freely? From this timeSuch I account thy love. Art thou afeardTo be the same in thine own act and valorAs thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have thatWhich thou esteem’st the ornament of life,And live a coward in thine own esteem,Letting “I dare not” wait upon
                                “I would, ”Like the poor cat i' th' adage?     Prithee,
                                peace:I dare do all that may become a man;Who dares do more is none.     What
                                beast was ’t, then,That made you break this enterprise to me?When you durst do it, then you were a man;And to be more than what you were, you wouldBe so much more the man. Nor time nor placeDid then adhere, and yet you would make both.They have made themselves, and that their fitness nowDoes unmake you. I have given suck, and knowHow tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me.I would, while it was smiling in my face,Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gumsAnd dashed the brains out, had I so sworn as youHave done to this.#LBSFORGOLDWhat news do you have?He has almost finished dinner. Why did you leave the dining
                            room?Has he asked for me?Don’t you know he has?We can’t go on with this plan. The king has just honored
                                me, and I have earned the good opinion of all sorts of people. I
                                want to enjoy these honors while the feeling is fresh and not throw
                                them away so soon.Were you drunk when you seemed so hopeful before? Have you gone to
                                sleep and woken up green and pale in fear of this idea? From now on
                                this is what I’ll think of your love. Are you afraid to act
                                the way you desire? Will you take the crown you want so badly, or
                                will you live as a coward, always saying “I
                                can’t” after you say “I want
                                to”? You’re like the poor cat in the old
                            story.Please, stop! I dare to do only what is proper for a man to do. He
                                who dares to do more is not a man at all.If you weren’t a man, then what kind of animal were you
                                when you first told me you wanted to do this? When you dared to do
                                it, that’s when you were a man. And if you go one step
                                further by doing what you dared to do before, you’ll be
                                that much more the man. The time and place weren’t right
                                before, but you would have gone ahead with the murder anyhow. Now
                                the time and place are just right, but they’re almost too
                                good for you. I have suckled a baby, and I know how sweet it is to
                                love the baby at my breast. But even as the baby was smiling up at
                                me, I would have plucked my nipple out of its mouth and smashed its
                                brains out against a wall if I had sworn to do that the same way you
                                have sworn to do this.
