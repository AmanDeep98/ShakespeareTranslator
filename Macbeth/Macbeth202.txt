     She
                                should have died hereafter.There would have been a time for such a word.Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,Creeps in this petty pace from day to dayTo the last syllable of recorded time,And all our yesterdays have lighted foolsThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor playerThat struts and frets his hour upon the stageAnd then is heard no more. It is a taleTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing.     Thou
                                comest to useThy tongue; thy story quickly.     Gracious
                                my lord,I should report that which I say I saw,But know not how to do ’t.     Well,
                                say, sir.As I did stand my watch upon the hill,I looked toward Birnam, and anon methoughtThe wood began to move.     Liar
                                and slave!Let me endure your wrath, if ’t be not so.Within this three mile may you see it coming;I say, a moving grove.#LBSFORGOLDShe would have died later anyway. That news was bound to come
                                someday. Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. The days creep slowly
                                along until the end of time. And every day that’s already
                                happened has taken fools that much closer to their deaths. Out, out,
                                brief candle. Life is nothing more than an illusion. It’s
                                like a poor actor who struts and worries for his hour on the stage
                                and then is never heard from again. Life is a story told by an
                                idiot, full of noise and emotional disturbance but devoid of
                                meaning.You’ve come to tell me something. Tell me quickly.My gracious lord, I should tell you what I saw, but I
                                don’t know how to say it.Just say it.As I was standing watch on the hill, I looked toward Birnam, and I
                                thought I saw the forest begin to move.Liar and slave!Punish me if it’s not true. Three miles from here you can
                                see it coming, a moving forest.
