No boasting like a fool.This deed I’ll do before this purpose cool.But no more sights!—Where are these gentlemen?Come, bring me where they are.#LBSFORGOLDTwo or three men, my lord, who brought the message
that Macduff has fled to England.
Fled to England?Yes, my good lord.Time, you thwart my dreadful plans. Unless a person does something
                                the second he thinks of it, he’ll never get a chance to do
                                it. From now on, as soon as I decide to do something I’m
                                going to act immediately. In fact, I’ll start following up
                                my thoughts with actions right now. I’ll raid
                                Macduff’s castle, seize the town of Fife, and kill his
                                wife, his children, and anyone else unfortunate enough to stand in
                                line for his inheritance. No more foolish talk. I will do this deed
                                before I lose my sense of purpose. But no more spooky
                                visions!—Where are the messengers? Come, bring me to
                                them.
