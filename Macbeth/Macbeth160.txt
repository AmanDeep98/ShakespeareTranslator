It is myself I mean, in whom I knowAll the particulars of vice so graftedThat, when they shall be opened, black MacbethWill seem as pure as snow, and the poor stateEsteem him as a lamb, being comparedWith my confineless harms.     Not
                                in the legionsOf horrid hell can come a devil more damnedIn evils to top Macbeth.     I
                                grant him bloody,Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sinThat has a name. But there’s no bottom, none,In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters,Your matrons, and your maids could not fill upThe cistern of my lust, and my desireAll continent impediments would o'erbearThat did oppose my will. Better MacbethThan such an one to reign.     Boundless
                                intemperanceIn nature is a tyranny. It hath beenThe untimely emptying of the happy throneAnd fall of many kings. But fear not yetTo take upon you what is yours. You mayConvey your pleasures in a spacious plentyAnd yet seem cold; the time you may so hoodwink.We have willing dames enough. There cannot beThat vulture in you to devour so manyAs will to greatness dedicate themselves,Finding it so inclined.#LBSFORGOLDI’m talking about myself. I know I have so many vices
                                that when people see all of them exposed, evil Macbeth will seem as
                                pure as snow in comparison, and poor Scotland will call him a sweet
                                lamb when they compare him to me and my infinite evils.Even in hell you couldn’t find a devil worse than
                                Macbeth.I admit that he’s murderous, lecherous, greedy, lying,
                                deceitful, violent, malicious, and guilty of every sin that has a
                                name. But there is no end, absolutely none, to my sexual desires.
                                Your wives, your daughters, your old women, and your young maids
                                together could not satisfy my lust. My desire would overpower all
                                restraints and anyone who stood in my way. It would be better for
                                Macbeth to rule than someone like me.Endless greed and lust in a man’s nature is a kind of
                                tyranny. It has caused the downfall of many kings. But
                                don’t be afraid to take the crown that belongs to you. You
                                can find a way to satisfy your desires in secret, while still
                                appearing virtuous. You can deceive everyone. There are more than
                                enough willing women around. Your lust can’t possibly be so
                                strong that you’d use up all the women willing to give
                                themselves to the king once they find out he wants them.
