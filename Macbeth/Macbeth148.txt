Thou ’dst never fear the net nor lime,The pitfall nor the gin.Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.My father is not dead, for all your saying.Yes, he is dead. How wilt thou do for a father?Nay, how will you do for a husband?Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.#LBSFORGOLDHe has a father, and yet he is fatherless.I have to go. If I stay longer, I’ll embarrass you and
                                disgrace myself by crying. I’m leaving now.Young man, your father’s dead. What are you going to do
