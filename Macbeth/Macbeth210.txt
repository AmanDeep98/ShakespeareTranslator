That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!If thou beest slain, and with no stroke of mine,My wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still.I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose armsAre hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,Or else my sword with an unbattered edgeI sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;By this great clatter, one of the greatest noteSeems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune,And more I beg not.This way, my lord. The castle’s gently rendered.The tyrant’s people on both sides do fight,The noble thanes do bravely in the war,The day almost itself professes yours,And little is to do.     We
                                have met with foesThat strike beside us.Enter, sir, the castle.#LBSFORGOLDThe noise is coming from over there. Tyrant, show your face! If
                                someone other than me kills you, the ghosts of my wife and children
                                will haunt me forever. I can’t be bothered to fight these
                                lame soldiers who only fight for money. I’ll either fight
                                you, Macbeth, or else I’ll put down my sword unused. You
                                must be over there. By the great noise, it sounds like one of the
                                highest-ranking men is being announced. I hope I find him! I ask for
                                nothing more than that.Come this way, my lord. The castle has been surrendered without a
                                fight. Macbeth’s soldiers are fighting on both sides. Our
                                noblemen are battling bravely. The victory is almost yours, and it
                                seems like there’s not much left to do.Our enemies fight as if they’re trying not to hurt
                            us.Sir, enter the castle.
