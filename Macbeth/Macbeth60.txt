     Whence
                                is that knocking?How is ’t with me when every noise appals me?What hands are here? Ha! They pluck out mine eyes.Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this bloodClean from my hand? No, this my hand will ratherThe multitudinous seas incarnadine,Making the green one red.My hands are of your color, but I shameTo wear a heart so white.     I
                                hear a knockingAt the south entry. Retire we to our chamber.A little water clears us of this deed.How easy is it, then! Your constancyHath left you unattended.Hark! More knocking.Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call usAnd show us to be watchers. Be not lostSo poorly in your thoughts.To know my deed, ’twere best not know myself.Wake Duncan with thy knocking. I would thou couldst.#LBSFORGOLDWhere is that knocking coming from? What’s happening to
                                me, that I’m frightened of every noise? (looking at his hands) Whose hands are
                                these? Ha! They’re plucking out my eyes. Will all the water
                                in the ocean wash this blood from my hands? No, instead my hands
                                will stain the seas scarlet, turning the green waters red.My hands are as red as yours, but I would be ashamed if my heart
                                were as pale and weak.I hear someone knocking at the south entry. Let’s go back
                                to our bedroom. A little water will wash away the evidence of our
                                guilt. It’s so simple! You’ve lost your
                            resolve.Listen! There’s more knocking. Put on your nightgown, in
                                case someone comes and sees that we’re awake. Snap out of
                                your daze.Rather than have to think about my crime, I’d prefer to
                                be completely unconscious.Wake Duncan with your knocking. I wish you could!
