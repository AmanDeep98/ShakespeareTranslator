Hang out our banners on the outward walls.The cry is still “They come!” Our
                                castle’s strengthWill laugh a siege to scorn. Here let them lieTill famine and the ague eat them up.Were they not forced with those that should be ours,We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,And beat them backward home.     What
                                is that noise?It is the cry of women, my good lord.I have almost forgot the taste of fears.The time has been my senses would have cooledTo hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hairWould at a dismal treatise rouse and stirAs life were in ’t. I have supped full with horrors.Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughtsCannot once start me.Wherefore was that cry?The queen, my lord, is dead.#LBSFORGOLDHang our flags on the outer walls. Everyone keeps yelling,
                                “Here they come!” Our castle is strong
                                enough to laugh off their seige. They can sit out there until they
                                die of hunger and disease. If it weren’t for the fact that
                                so many of our soldiers revolted and joined them, we could have met
                                them out in front of the castle, man to man, and beaten them back to
                                England.What’s that noise?It’s women crying, my good lord.I’ve almost forgotten what fear feels like. There was a
                                time when I would have been terrified by a shriek in the night, and
                                the hair on my skin would have stood up when I heard a ghost story.
                                But now I’ve had my fill of real horrors. Horrible things
                                are so familiar that they can’t startle me.What was that cry for?The queen is dead, my lord.
