     Sweet
                                remembrancer!Now, good digestion wait on appetite,And health on both!May ’t please your highness sit.Here had we now our country’s honor roofed,Were the graced person of our Banquo present,Who may I rather challenge for unkindnessThan pity for mischance.     His
                                absence, sir,Lays blame upon his promise. Please ’t your highnessTo grace us with your royal company?The table’s full.Here is a place reserved, sir.Where?Here, my good lord. What is ’t that moves your
                            highness?Which of you have done this?     What,
                                my good lord?
(to GHOST) Thou canst not say I did it. Never shakeThy gory locks at me.#LBSFORGOLDIt’s nice of you to remind me. (raising a glass to toast his guests) Since good
                                digestion requires a good appetite, and good health requires both of
                                those, here’s to good appetites, good digestion, and good
                                health!Why don’t you have a seat, your highness?We would have all the nobility of Scotland gathered under one
                                roof, if only Banquo were here. I hope it turns out that
                                he’s late out of rudeness, and not because something bad
                                has happened to him.His absence means he’s broken his promise, sir. If it
                                pleases you, your highness, why don’t you sit with us and
                                grace us with your royal company?The table’s full.Here’s an empty seat, sir.Where?
(pointing to where the GHOST sits) Here, my good lord.
                                What’s wrong, your highness?
(seeing the GHOST) Which one of you did this?What, my good lord?
(to the GHOST) You can’t say I did it. Don’t shake
                                your bloody head at me.
