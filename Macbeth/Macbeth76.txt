And when we have our naked frailties hid,That suffer in exposure, let us meetAnd question this most bloody piece of work,To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us.In the great hand of God I stand, and thenceAgainst the undivulged pretense I fightOf treasonous malice.And so do I.     So
                                all.Let’s briefly put on manly readiness,And meet i' th' hall together.     Well
                                contented.What will you do? Let’s not consort with them.To show an unfelt sorrow is an officeWhich the false man does easy. I’ll to England.To Ireland, I. Our separated fortuneShall keep us both the safer. Where we are,There’s daggers in men’s smiles. The near in
                                blood,The nearer bloody.This murderous shaft that’s shotHath not yet lighted, and our safest wayIs to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse,And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,But shift away. There’s warrant in that theftWhich steals itself when there’s no mercy left.#LBSFORGOLDWhen we’re properly dressed for the cold, let’s
                                meet and discuss this bloody crime to see if we can figure anything
                                out. Right now we’re shaken up by fears and doubts.
                                I’m putting myself in God’s hands, and with his
                                help I plan to fight against the secret plot that caused this
                                treasonous murder.So will I.So will we all.Let’s get dressed quickly and then meet in the
                            hall.Agreed.What are you going to do? Let’s not stay here with them.
                                It’s easy for a liar to pretend to feel sorrow when he
                                actually feels none. I’m going to England.I’ll go to Ireland. We’ll both be safer if we go
                                separate ways. Wherever we go, men will smile at us while hiding
                                daggers. Our closest relatives are the ones most likely to murder
                                us.We haven’t yet encountered that danger, and the best
                                thing to do is avoid it entirely. With that in mind, let’s
                                get on our horses. We’d better not worry about saying
                                polite good-byes; we should just get away quickly. There’s
                                good reason to escape when there’s no mercy to be found
                                anymore.
