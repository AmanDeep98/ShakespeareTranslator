                                to govern?No, not to live.—O nation miserable,With an untitled tyrant bloody-sceptered,When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,Since that the truest issue of thy throneBy his own interdiction stands accursed,And does blaspheme his breed?—Thy royal fatherWas a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!These evils thou repeat’st upon thyselfHave banished me from Scotland.—O my breast,Thy hope ends here!     Macduff,
                                this noble passion,Child of integrity, hath from my soulWiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughtsTo thy good truth and honor. Devilish MacbethBy many of these trains hath sought to win meInto his power, and modest wisdom plucks meFrom overcredulous haste. But God aboveDeal between thee and me, for even nowI put myself to thy direction andUnspeak mine own detraction, here abjureThe taints and blames I laid upon myself,For strangers to my nature. I am yetUnknown to woman, never was forsworn,Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,At no time broke my faith, would not betrayThe devil to his fellow, and delightNo less in truth than life. My first false speakingWas this upon myself. What I am truly,Is thine and my poor country’s to command.#LBSFORGOLD
(to MALCOLM) Fit to be king? You’re not fit to live!—Oh miserable nation, ruled
                                by a usurping, murderous tyrant, when will you see peaceful days
                                again? The man who has a legal right to the throne is, by his own
                                admission, a cursed man and a disgrace to the royal family.—Your royal father Duncan
                                was a virtuous king. Your mother spent more time on her knees in
                                prayer than she did standing up, and she lived a life of absolute
                                piety. Good-bye. The evils you have described inside yourself have
                                driven me out of Scotland forever. Oh my heart, your hope is
                            dead!Macduff, this passionate outburst, which proves your integrity,
                                has removed my doubts about you and made me realize that you really
                                are trustworthy and honorable. That devil Macbeth has tried many
                                times to trick me and lure me into his power, and prudence prevents
                                me from believing people too quickly. But with God as my witness, I
                                will let myself be guided by you, and I take back my confession. I
                                take back all the bad things I said about myself, because none of
                                those flaws are really part of my character. I’m still a
                                virgin. I have never told a lie. I barely care about what I already
                                own, let alone feel jealous of another’s possessions. I
                                have never broken a promise. I wouldn’t betray the devil
                                himself. I love truth as much as I love life. The lies I told about
                                my character are actually the first false words I have ever spoken.
                                The person who I really am is ready to serve you and our poor
                                country.
