Why, how now, Hecate! You look angerly.Have I not reason, beldams as you are?Saucy and overbold, how did you dareTo trade and traffic with MacbethIn riddles and affairs of death,And I, the mistress of your charms,The close contriver of all harms,Was never called to bear my part,Or show the glory of our art?And, which is worse, all you have doneHath been but for a wayward son,Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,Loves for his own ends, not for you.But make amends now. Get you gone,And at the pit of AcheronMeet me i' th' morning. Thither heWill come to know his destiny.Your vessels and your spells provide,Your charms and everything beside.I am for the air. This night I’ll spendUnto a dismal and a fatal end.Great business must be wrought ere noon.Upon the corner of the moonThere hangs a vap'rous drop profound.I’ll catch it ere it come to ground.And that distilled by magic sleightsShall raise such artificial spritesAs by the strength of their illusionShall draw him on to his confusion.#LBSFORGOLDWhat’s wrong, Hecate? You look angry.Don’t I have a reason to be angry, you disobedient hags?
                                How dare you give Macbeth riddles and prophecies about his future
                                without telling me? I am your boss and the source of your powers. I
                                am the one who secretly decides what evil things happen, but you
                                never called me to join in and show off my own powers. And
                                what’s worse, you’ve done all this for a man who
                                behaves like a spoiled brat, angry and hateful. Like all spoiled
                                sons, he chases after what he wants and doesn’t care about
                                you. But you can make it up to me. Go away now and in the morning
                                meet me in the pit by the river in hell. Macbeth will go there to
                                learn his destiny. You bring your cauldrons, your spells, your
                                charms, and everything else. I’m about to fly away.
                                I’ll spend tonight working to make something horrible
                                happen. I have a lot to do before noon. An important droplet is
                                hanging from the corner of the moon. I’ll catch it before
                                it falls to the ground. When I work it over with magic spells, the
                                drop will produce magical spirits that will trick Macbeth with
                                illusions.
