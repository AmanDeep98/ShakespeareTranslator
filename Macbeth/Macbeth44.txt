                                we should fail?     We
                                fail?But screw your courage to the sticking-place,And we’ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep—Whereto the rather shall his day’s hard journeySoundly invite him—his two chamberlainsWill I with wine and wassail so convinceThat memory, the warder of the brain,Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reasonA limbeck only: when in swinish sleepTheir drenchèd natures lie as in a death,What cannot you and I perform uponThe unguarded Duncan? What not put uponHis spongy officers, who shall bear the guiltOf our great quell?     Bring
                                forth men-children only,For thy undaunted mettle should composeNothing but males. Will it not be received,When we have marked with blood those sleepy twoOf his own chamber and used their very daggers,That they have done ’t?#LBSFORGOLDBut if we fail—We, fail? If you get your courage up, we can’t fail. When
                                Duncan is asleep—the day’s hard journey has
                                definitely made him tired—I’ll get his two
                                servants so drunk that their memory will go up in smoke through the
                                chimneys of their brains. When they lie asleep like pigs, so drunk
                                they’ll be dead to the world, what won’t you and I
                                be able to do to the unguarded Duncan? And whatever we do, we can
                                lay all the blame on the drunken servants.May you only give birth to male children, because your fearless
                                spirit should create nothing that isn’t masculine. Once we
                                have covered the two servants with blood, and used their daggers to
                                kill, won’t people believe that they were the
                            culprits?
