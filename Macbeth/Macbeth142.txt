                                is this so?Ay, sir, all this is so. But whyStands Macbeth thus amazedly?Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,And show the best of our delights.I’ll charm th' air to give a sound,While you perform your antic round.That this great king may kindly say,Our duties did his welcome pay.Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hourStand aye accursèd in the calendar!Come in, without there.     What’s
                                your grace’s will?Saw you the weird sisters?     No,
                                my lord.Came they not by you?     No,
                                indeed, my lord.Infected be the air whereon they ride,And damned all those that trust them! I did hearThe galloping of horse. Who was ’t came by?#LBSFORGOLDWhat? Is this true?Yes, this is true, but why do you stand there so dumbfounded?
                                Come, sisters, let’s cheer him up and show him our talents.
                                I will charm the air to produce music while you all dance around
                                like crazy, so this king will say we did our duty and entertained
                                him.Where are they? Gone? Let this evil hour be marked forever in the
                                calendar as cursed. (calls to someone
                                    offstage) You outside, come in!What does your grace want?Did you see the weird sisters?No, my lord.Didn’t they pass by you?No, indeed, my lord.The air on which they ride is infected. Damn all those who trust
                                them! I heard the galloping of horses. Who was it that came
                            here?
