The king hath happily received, Macbeth,The news of thy success, and when he readsThy personal venture in the rebels' fight,His wonders and his praises do contendWhich should be thine or his. Silenced with that,In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,Strange images of death. As thick as taleCan post with post, and every one did bearThy praises in his kingdom’s great defense,And poured them down before him.     We
                                are sentTo give thee from our royal master thanks,Only to herald thee into his sight,Not pay thee.And, for an earnest of a greater honor,He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:In which addition, hail, most worthy thane,For it is thine.     What,
                                can the devil speak true?The thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress meIn borrowed robes?     Who
                                was the thane lives yet,But under heavy judgment bears that lifeWhich he deserves to lose. Whether he was combinedWith those of Norway, or did line the rebelWith hidden help and vantage, or that with bothHe labored in his country’s wrack, I know not;But treasons capital, confessed and proved,Have overthrown him.#LBSFORGOLDThe king was happy to hear of your success, Macbeth. Whenever he
                                hears the story of your exploits in the fight against the rebels, he
                                becomes so amazed it makes him speechless. He was also shocked to
                                learn that on the same day you fought the rebels you also fought
                                against the army of Norway, and that you weren’t the least
                                bit afraid of death, even as you killed everyone around you.
                                Messenger after messenger delivered news of your bravery to the king
                                with praise for how you defended his country.The king sent us to give you his thanks and to bring you to him.
                                Your real reward won’t come from us.And to give you a taste of what’s in store for you, he
                                told me to call you the thane of Cawdor. So hail, thane of Cawdor!
                                That title belongs to you now.
(shocked) Can the devil tell the
                                truth?The thane of Cawdor is still alive. Why are you giving me his title?The man who was the thane of Cawdor is still alive, but
                                he’s been sentenced to death, and he deserves to die. I
                                don’t know whether he fought on Norway’s side, or
                                if he secretly aided the rebels, or if he fought with both of our
                                enemies. But his treason, which has been proven, and to which
                                he’s confessed, means he’s finished.
