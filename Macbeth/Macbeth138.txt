Then live, Macduff. What need I fear of thee?But yet I’ll make assurance double sure,And take a bond of fate. Thou shalt not live,That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,And sleep in spite of thunder.What is thisThat rises like the issue of a king,And wears upon his baby-brow the roundAnd top of sovereignty?     Listen
                                but speak not to ’t.Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no careWho chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are.Macbeth shall never vanquished be untilGreat Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane HillShall come against him.     That
                                will never be.Who can impress the forest, bid the treeUnfix his earthbound root? Sweet bodements! Good!Rebellious dead, rise never till the woodOf Birnam rise, and our high-placed MacbethShall live the lease of nature, pay his breathTo time and mortal custom. Yet my heartThrobs to know one thing. Tell me, if your artCan tell so much: shall Banquo’s issue everReign in this kingdom?#LBSFORGOLDThen I don’t need to kill Macduff. I have no reason to
                                fear him. But even so, I’ll make doubly sure. I’ll
                                guarantee my own fate by having you killed, Macduff. That way I can
                                conquer my own fear and sleep easy at night.What is this spirit that looks like the son of a king and wears a
                                crown on his young head?Listen but don’t speak to it.Be brave like the lion and proud. Don’t even worry about
                                who hates you, who resents you, and who conspires against you.
                                Macbeth will never be defeated until Birnam Wood marches to fight
                                you at Dunsinane Hill.That will never happen. Who can command the forest and make the
                                trees pull their roots out of the earth? These were sweet omens!
                                Good! My murders will never come back to threaten me until the
                                forest of Birnam gets up and moves, and I will be king for my entire
                                natural life. But my heart is still throbbing to know one thing.
                                Tell me, if your dark powers can see this far: will
                                Banquo’s sons ever reign in this kingdom?
