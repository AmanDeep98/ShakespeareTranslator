Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those menOur pleasure?They are, my lord, without the palace gate.Bring them before us.To be thus is nothing,But to be safely thus. Our fears in BanquoStick deep, and in his royalty of natureReigns that which would be feared. 'Tis much he dares,And to that dauntless temper of his mindHe hath a wisdom that doth guide his valorTo act in safety. There is none but heWhose being I do fear, and under himMy genius is rebuked, as it is saidMark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sistersWhen first they put the name of king upon meAnd bade them speak to him. Then, prophetlike,They hailed him father to a line of kings.Upon my head they placed a fruitless crownAnd put a barren scepter in my grip,Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand,No son of mine succeeding. If ’t be so,For Banquo’s issue have I filed my mind;For them the gracious Duncan have I murdered;Put rancors in the vessel of my peaceOnly for them; and mine eternal jewelGiven to the common enemy of man,To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!Rather than so, come fate into the list,And champion me to th' utterance. Who’s
                            there?#LBSFORGOLD
(to the SERVANT) You there, let me have a word with
                                you. Are those men waiting for me?They’re waiting outside the palace gate, my lord.Bring them to me.To be the king is nothing if I’m not safe as the king.
                                I’m very afraid of Banquo. There’s something noble
                                about him that makes me fear him. He’s willing to take
                                risks, and his mind never stops working. He has the wisdom to act
                                bravely but also safely. I’m not afraid of anyone but him.
                                Around him, my guardian angel is frightened, just as Mark
                                Antony’s angel supposedly feared Octavius Caesar. Banquo
                                chided the witches when they first called me king, asking them to
                                tell him his own future. Then, like prophets, they named him the
                                father to a line of kings. They gave me a crown and a scepter that I
                                can’t pass on. Someone outside my family will take these
                                things away from me, since no son of mine will take my place as
                                king. If this is true, then I’ve tortured my conscience and
                                murdered the gracious Duncan for Banquo’s sons.
                                I’ve ruined my own peace for their benefit. I’ve
                                handed over my everlasting soul to the devil so that they could be
                                kings. Banquo’s sons, kings! Instead of watching that
                                happen, I will challenge fate to battle and fight to the death.
                                Who’s there!
