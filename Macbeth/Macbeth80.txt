How goes the world, sir, now?     Why,
                                see you not?Is ’t known who did this more than bloody deed?Those that Macbeth hath slain.     Alas,
                                the day!What good could they pretend?     They
                                were suborned.Malcolm and Donalbain, the king’s two sons,Are stol'n away and fled, which puts upon themSuspicion of the deed.'Gainst nature still!Thriftless ambition, that will raven upThine own lives' means! Then ’tis most likeThe sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.He is already named and gone to SconeTo be invested.Where is Duncan’s body?Carried to Colmekill,The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,And guardian of their bones.     Will
                                you to Scone?No, cousin, I’ll to Fife.Well, I will thither.#LBSFORGOLDHow are things going now?Can’t you see for yourself?Does anyone know who committed this horrible crime?The servants Macbeth killed.It’s too bad he killed them. What good would it have done
                                those men to kill Duncan?They were paid to betray their master. Malcolm and Donalbain, the
                                king’s two sons, have run away and fled, which makes them
                                the prime suspects.Everything about this is unnatural! What a stupid ambition,
                                causing a son to kill the father who supports him. Then it looks
                                like Macbeth will become king.He has already been named king and has left for Scone to be
                                crowned.Where is Duncan’s body?It was carried to Colmekill to be placed in the tomb of his
                                ancestors, where their bones are kept safe.Are you going to Scone?No, cousin, I’m going to Fife.Well, I’ll go to Scone.
