What bloody man is that? He can report,As seemeth by his plight, of the revoltThe newest state.     This
                                is the sergeantWho like a good and hardy soldier fought'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!Say to the king the knowledge of the broilAs thou didst leave it.     Doubtful
                                it stood,As two spent swimmers that do cling togetherAnd choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald—Worthy to be a rebel, for to thatThe multiplying villanies of natureDo swarm upon him—from the Western IslesOf kerns and gallowglasses is supplied,And fortune, on his damnèd quarrel smiling,Showed like a rebel’s whore. But all’s too weak,For brave Macbeth—well he deserves that
                                name—Disdaining fortune, with his brandished steel,Which smoked with bloody execution,Like valor’s minion carved out his passageTill he faced the slave;Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,Till he unseamed him from the nave to th' chops,And fixed his head upon our battlements.O valiant cousin! Worthy gentleman!#LBSFORGOLDWho is this bloody man? Judging from his appearance, I bet he can
                                tell us the latest news about the revolt.This is the brave sergeant who fought to keep me from being
                                captured. Hail, brave friend! Tell the king what was happening in
                                the battle when you left it.For a while you couldn’t tell who would win. The armies
                                were like two exhausted swimmers clinging to each other and
                                struggling in the water, unable to move. The villainous rebel
                                Macdonwald was supported by foot soldiers and horsemen from Ireland
                                and the Hebrides, and Lady Luck was with him, smiling cruelly at his
                                enemies as if she were his whore. But Luck and Macdonwald together
                                weren’t strong enough. Brave Macbeth, laughing at Luck,
                                chopped his way through to Macdonwald, who didn’t even have
                                time to say good-bye or shake hands before Macbeth split him open
                                from his navel to his jawbone and stuck his head on our castle
                                walls.My brave relative! What a worthy man!
