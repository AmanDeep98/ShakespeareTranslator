Sent he to Macduff?He did, and with an absolute “Sir, not I,”The cloudy messenger turns me his back,And hums, as who should say “You’ll rue the
                                timeThat clogs me with this answer.”     And
                                that well mightAdvise him to a caution, t' hold what distanceHis wisdom can provide. Some holy angelFly to the court of England and unfoldHis message ere he come, that a swift blessingMay soon return to this our suffering countryUnder a hand accursed!I’ll send my prayers with him.#LBSFORGOLDDid he tell Macduff to return to Scotland?He did, but Macduff told the messenger, “No
                                way.” The messenger scowled and rudely turned his back
                                on Macduff, as if to say, “You’ll regret the
                                day you gave me this answer.”That might well keep Macduff away from Scotland. Some holy angel
                                should go to the court of England and give Macduff a message. He
                                should return quickly to free our country, which is suffering under
                                a tyrant!I’ll send my prayers with him.
