                                does. He did appoint so.The night has been unruly. Where we lay,Our chimneys were blown down and, as they say,Lamentings heard i' th' air, strange screams of
                                death,And prophesying with accents terribleOf dire combustion and confused eventsNew hatched to the woeful time. The obscure birdClamored the livelong night. Some say the EarthWas feverous and did shake.     'Twas
                                a rough night.My young remembrance cannot parallelA fellow to it.     O
                                horror, horror, horror!Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!What’s the matter?Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.Most sacrilegious murder hath broke opeThe Lord’s anointed temple, and stole thenceThe life o' th' building!     What
                                is ’t you say? “The life”?Mean you his majesty?#LBSFORGOLDHe is. He told us to arrange it.The night has been chaotic. The wind blew down through the
                                chimneys where we were sleeping. People are saying they heard cries
                                of grief in the air, strange screams of death, and terrible voices
                                predicting catastrophes that will usher in a woeful new age. The owl
                                made noise all night. Some people say that the earth shook as if it
                                had a fever.It was a rough night.I’m too young to remember anything like it.Oh, horror, horror, horror! This is beyond words and beyond
                                belief!What’s the matter?The worst thing imaginable has happened. A murderer has broken
                                into  God’s templeMacduff compares Duncan’s corpse to a church that has been broken into, which confuses his listeners.God’s temple and stolen the life out of it.What are you talking about? “The
                            life”?Do you mean the king?
