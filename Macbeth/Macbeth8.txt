     God
                                save the king.Whence cam’st thou, worthy thane?     From
                                Fife, great king,Where the Norweyan banners flout the skyAnd fan our people cold.Norway himself, with terrible numbers,Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,Till that Bellona’s bridegroom, lapped in proof,Confronted him with self-comparisons,Point against point, rebellious arm 'gainst arm,Curbing his lavish spirit; and to conclude,The victory fell on us.     Great
                                happiness!     That
                                nowSweno, the Norways' king, craves composition.Nor would we deign him burial of his menTill he disbursed at Saint Colme’s InchTen thousand dollars to our general use.No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceiveOur bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,And with his former title greet Macbeth.I’ll see it done.What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.#LBSFORGOLDGod save the king!Where have you come from, worthy thane?Great king, I’ve come from Fife, where the Norwegian flag
                                flies, mocking our country and frightening our people. Leading an
                                enormous army and assisted by that disloyal traitor, the thane of
                                Cawdor, the king of Norway began a bloody battle. But outfitted in
                                his battle-weathered armor, Macbeth met the Norwegian attacks shot
                                for shot, as if he were the goddess of war’s husband.
                                Finally he broke the enemy’s spirit, and we were
                                victorious.Great happiness!So now Sweno, the Norwegian king, wants a treaty. We told him we
                                wouldn’t even let him bury his men until he retreated to
                                Saint Colme’s Inch and paid us ten thousand dollars.The thane of Cawdor will never again betray me. Go announce that
                                he will be executed, and tell Macbeth that Cawdor’s titles
                                will be given to him.I’ll get it done right away.The thane of Cawdor has lost what the noble Macbeth has
                            won.
