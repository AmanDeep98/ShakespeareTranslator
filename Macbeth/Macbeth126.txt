My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,Which can interpret farther. Only I sayThings have been strangely borne. The gracious DuncanWas pitied of Macbeth. Marry, he was dead.And the right-valiant Banquo walked too late,Whom, you may say, if ’t please you, Fleance killed,For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.Who cannot want the thought how monstrousIt was for Malcolm and for DonalbainTo kill their gracious father? Damnèd fact!How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straightIn pious rage the two delinquents tearThat were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too,For ’twould have angered any heart aliveTo hear the men deny ’t. So that, I say,He has borne all things well. And I do thinkThat had he Duncan’s sons under his key—As, an’t please heaven, he shall not—they
                                should findWhat ’twere to kill a father. So should Fleance.But, peace! For from broad words, and 'cause he failedHis presence at the tyrant’s feast, I hearMacduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tellWhere he bestows himself?     The
                                son of Duncan—From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth—Lives in the English court and is receivedOf the most pious Edward with such graceThat the malevolence of fortune nothingTakes from his high respect. Thither MacduffIs gone to pray the holy king upon his aidTo wake Northumberland and warlike Siward,That by the help of these—with Him aboveTo ratify the work—we may againGive to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,Do faithful homage and receive free honors.All which we pine for now. And this reportHath so exasperated the king that hePrepares for some attempt of war.#LBSFORGOLDWhat I’ve already said shows you we think alike, so you
                                can draw your own conclusions. All I’m saying is that
                                strange things have been going on. Macbeth pitied
                                Duncan—after Duncan was dead. And Banquo went out
                                walking too late at night. If you like, we can say that Fleance must
                                have killed him, because Fleance fled the scene of the crime.
                                Clearly, men should not go out walking too late! And who can help
                                thinking how monstrous it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill
                                their gracious father? Such a heinous crime—how it
                                saddened                                 MacbethLennox speaks sarcastically throughout this speech, making it clear that he thinks Macbeth is guilty of the murders.Macbeth! Wasn’t it loyal of him to kill those two
                                servants right away, while they were still drunk and asleep? That
                                was the right thing to do, wasn’t it? Yes, and it was the
                                wise thing, too, because we all would have been outraged to hear
                                those two deny their crime. Considering all this, I think Macbeth
                                has handled things well. If he had Duncan’s sons in
                                prison—which I hope won’t
                                happen—they would find out how awful the punishment is
                                for those who kill their fathers, and so would Fleance. But enough
                                of that. I hear that Macduff is out of favor with the king because
                                he speaks his mind too plainly, and because he failed to show up at
                                Macbeth’s feast. Can you tell me where he’s hiding
                                himself?Duncan’s son Malcolm, whose birthright and throne Macbeth
                                has stolen, lives in the English court. There, the saintly King
                                Edward treats Malcolm so well that despite Malcolm’s
                                misfortunes, he’s not deprived of respect. Macduff went
                                there to ask King Edward for help. He wants Edward to help him form
                                an alliance with the people of Northumberland and their lord,
                                Siward. Macduff hopes that with their help—and with the
                                help of God above—he may once again put food on our
                                tables, bring peace back to our nights, free our feasts and banquets
                                from violent murders, allow us to pay proper homage to our king, and
                                receive honors freely. Those are the things we pine for now. Macbeth
                                has heard this news and he is so angry that he’s preparing
                                for war.
