     Would
                                I could answerThis comfort with the like. But I have wordsThat would be howled out in the desert air,Where hearing should not latch them.     What
                                concern they?The general cause, or is it a fee-griefDue to some single breast?     No
                                mind that’s honestBut in it shares some woe, though the main partPertains to you alone.If it be mine,Keep it not from me. Quickly let me have it.Let not your ears despise my tongue forever,Which shall possess them with the heaviest soundThat ever yet they heard.     Hum!
                                I guess at it.Your castle is surprised, your wife and babesSavagely slaughtered. To relate the manner,Were, on the quarry of these murdered deerTo add the death of you.     Merciful
                                heaven!What, man! Ne'er pull your hat upon your brows.Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speakWhispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break.My children too?Wife, children, servants, all that could be found.#LBSFORGOLDI wish I could repay this happy news with good news of my own. But
                                I have some news that should be howled in a barren desert where
                                nobody can hear it.What is this news about? Does it affect all of us? Or just one of
                                us?No decent man can keep from sharing in the sorrow, but my news
                                affects you alone.If it’s for me, don’t keep it from me. Let me
                                have it now.I hope you won’t hate me forever after I say these
                                things, because I will soon fill your ears with the most dreadful
                                news you have ever heard.I think I can guess what you’re about to say.Your castle was attacked. Your wife and children were savagely
                                slaughtered. If I told you how they were killed, it would cause you
                                so much pain that it would kill you too, and add your body to the
                                pile of murdered corpses.Merciful heaven! (to MACDUFF) Come on, man, don’t keep your
                                grief hidden. Put your sorrow into words. The grief you keep inside
                                you will whisper in your heart until it breaks.They killed my children too?They killed your wife, your children, your servants, anyone they
                                could find.
