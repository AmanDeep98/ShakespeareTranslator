Come on, gentle my lord,Sleek o'er your rugged looks. Be bright and jovialAmong your guests tonight.     So
                                shall I, love,And so, I pray, be you. Let your remembranceApply to Banquo; present him eminence,Both with eye and tongue: unsafe the while that weMust lave our honors in these flattering streams,And make our faces vizards to our hearts,Disguising what they are.     You
                                must leave this.Oh, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!Thou know’st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.But in them nature’s copy’s not eterne.There’s comfort yet; they are assailable.Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flownHis cloistered flight, ere to black Hecate’s summonsThe shard-borne beetle with his drowsy humsHath rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be doneA deed of dreadful note.     What’s
                                to be done?#LBSFORGOLDCome on, relax, dear. Put on a happy face and look cheerful and
                                agreeable for your guests tonight.That’s exactly what I’ll do, my love, and I hope
                                you’ll do the same. Give Banquo your special attention.
                                Talk to him and look at him in a way that will make him feel
                                important. We’re in a dangerous situation, where we have to
                                flatter him and hide our true feelings.You have to stop talking like this.Argh! I feel like my mind is full of scorpions, my dear wife. You
                                know that Banquo and his son Fleance are still alive.But they can’t live forever.That’s comforting. They can be killed, it’s
                                true. So be cheerful. Before the bat flies through the castle, and
                                before the dung beetle makes his little humming noise to tell us
                                it’s nighttime, a dreadful deed will be done.What are you going to do?
