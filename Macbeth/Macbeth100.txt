Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful dayAnd with thy bloody and invisible handCancel and tear to pieces that great bondWhich keeps me pale. Light thickens, and the crowMakes wing to th' rooky wood.Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;Whiles night’s black agents to their preys do rouse.Thou marvel’st at my words: but hold thee still.Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.So, prithee, go with me.#LBSFORGOLDIt’s better you don’t know about it until after
                                it’s done, when you can applaud it. (to the night) Come, night, and blindfold the
                                kindhearted day. Use your bloody and invisible hand to tear up
                                Banquo’s lease on life, which keeps me in fear. (to himself) The sky’s getting
                                dark, and the crow is returning home to the woods. The gentle
                                creatures of the day are falling asleep, while night’s
                                predators are waking up to look for their prey. (to LADY MACBETH) You seem surprised at my words, but don’t
                                question me yet. Bad deeds force you to commit more bad deeds. So
                                please, come with me.
