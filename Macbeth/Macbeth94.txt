We shall, my lord,Perform what you command us.     Though
                                our lives—Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at mostI will advise you where to plant yourselves,Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' th' time,The moment on ’t; for ’t must be done tonight,And something from the palace; always thoughtThat I require a clearness. And with him—To leave no rubs nor botches in the work—Fleance, his son, that keeps him company,Whose absence is no less material to meThan is his father’s, must embrace the fateOf that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart.I’ll come to you anon.We are resolved, my lord.I’ll call upon you straight. Abide within.It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul’s flight,If it find heaven, must find it out tonight.#LBSFORGOLDWe’ll do what you want us to, my lord.Though our lives—
(interrupts him) I can see the
                                determination in your eyes. Within the next hour I’ll tell
                                you where to go and exactly when to strike. It must be done tonight,
                                away from the palace. Always remember that I must be free from
                                suspicion. For the plan to work perfectly, you must kill both Banquo
                                and his son, Fleance, who keeps him company. Getting rid of Fleance
                                is as important to me as knocking off Banquo. Each of you should
                                make up your own mind about whether you’re going to do
                                this. I’ll come to you soon.We have decided, my lord. We’re in.I’ll call for you soon. Stay inside.The deal is closed. Banquo, if your soul is going to make it to
                                heaven, tonight’s the night.
