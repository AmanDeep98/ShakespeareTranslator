Is execution done on Cawdor? Are notThose in commission yet returned?     My
                                liege,They are not yet come back. But I have spokeWith one that saw him die, who did reportThat very frankly he confessed his treasons,Implored your highness' pardon, and set forthA deep repentance. Nothing in his lifeBecame him like the leaving it. He diedAs one that had been studied in his deathTo throw away the dearest thing he owedAs ’twere a careless trifle.     There’s
                                no artTo find the mind’s construction in the face.He was a gentleman on whom I builtAn absolute trust.
(to MACBETH) O worthiest cousin,The sin of my ingratitude even nowWas heavy on me. Thou art so far beforeThat swiftest wing of recompense is slowTo overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,That the proportion both of thanks and paymentMight have been mine! Only I have left to say,More is thy due than more than all can pay.#LBSFORGOLDHas the former thane of Cawdor been executed yet? Haven’t
                                the people in charge of that come back?My king, they haven’t come back yet. But I spoke with
                                someone who saw Cawdor die, and he said that Cawdor openly confessed
                                his treasons, begged your highness’s forgiveness, and
                                repented deeply. He never did anything in his whole life that looked
                                as good as the way he died. He died like someone who had practiced
                                how to toss away his most cherished possession as if it were a
                                worthless a piece of garbage.There’s no way to read a man’s mind by looking
                                at his face. I trusted Cawdor completely.
(to MACBETH) My worthiest kinsman! Just this moment I was feeling
                                guilty for not having thanked you enough. You have done so much for
                                me so fast that it has been impossible to reward you properly. If
                                you deserved less, then perhaps my payment would have matched your
                                deeds! All I can say is that I owe you more than I can ever
                            repay.
