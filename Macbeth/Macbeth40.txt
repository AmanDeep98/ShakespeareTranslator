If it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere wellIt were done quickly. If the assassinationCould trammel up the consequence, and catchWith his surcease success; that but this blowMight be the be-all and the end-all here,But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,We’d jump the life to come. But in these casesWe still have judgment here, that we but teachBloody instructions, which, being taught, returnTo plague th' inventor: this even-handed justiceCommends the ingredients of our poisoned chaliceTo our own lips. He’s here in double trust:First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,Who should against his murderer shut the door,Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this DuncanHath borne his faculties so meek, hath beenSo clear in his great office, that his virtuesWill plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, againstThe deep damnation of his taking-off;And pity, like a naked newborn babe,Striding the blast, or heaven’s cherubim, horsedUpon the sightless couriers of the air,Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spurTo prick the sides of my intent, but onlyVaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itselfAnd falls on th' other.#LBSFORGOLDIf this business would really be finished when I did the deed,
                                then it would be best to get it over with quickly. If the
                                assassination of the king could work like a net, sweeping up
                                everything and preventing any consequences, then the murder would be
                                the be-all and end-all of the whole affair, and I would gladly put
                                my soul and the afterlife at risk to do it. But for crimes like
                                these there are still punishments in this world. By committing
                                violent crimes we only teach other people to commit violence, and
                                the violence of our students will come back to plague us teachers.
                                Justice, being equal to everyone, forces us to drink from the
                                poisoned cup that we serve to others. The king trusts me in two
                                ways. First of all, I am his kinsman and his subject, so I should
                                always try to protect him. Second, I am his host, so I should be
                                closing the door in his murderer’s face, not trying to
                                murder him myself. Besides, Duncan has been such a humble leader, so
                                free of corruption, that his virtuous legacy will speak for him when
                                he dies, as if angels were playing trumpets against the injustice of
                                his murder. Pity, like an innocent newborn baby, will ride the wind
                                with winged angels on invisible horses through the air to spread
                                news of the horrible deed to everyone everywhere. People will shed a
                                flood of tears that will drown the wind like a horrible downpour of
                                rain. I can’t spur myself to action. The only thing
                                motivating me is ambition, which makes people rush ahead of
                                themselves toward disaster.
