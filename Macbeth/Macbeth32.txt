What is your tidings?The king comes here tonight.     Thou
                                'rt mad to say it.Is not thy master with him, who, were ’t so,Would have informed for preparation?So please you, it is true: our thane is coming.One of my fellows had the speed of him,Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely moreThan would make up his message.Give him tending.He brings great news.The raven himself is hoarseThat croaks the fatal entrance of DuncanUnder my battlements. Come, you spiritsThat tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,And fill me from the crown to the toe top-fullOf direst cruelty. Make thick my blood.Stop up the access and passage to remorse,That no compunctious visitings of natureShake my fell purpose, nor keep peace betweenThe effect and it! Come to my woman’s breasts,And take my milk for gall, you murd'ring ministers,Wherever in your sightless substancesYou wait on nature’s mischief. Come, thick night,And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the darkTo cry “Hold, hold!”#LBSFORGOLDWhat news do you bring?The king is coming here tonight.You must be crazy to say that! Isn’t Macbeth with the
                                king, and wouldn’t Macbeth have told me in advance so I
                                could prepare, if the king were really coming?I’m sorry, but it’s the truth. Macbeth is
                                coming. He sent a messenger ahead of him who arrived here so out of
                                breath that he could barely speak his message.Take good care of him. He brings great news.So the messenger is short of breath, like a hoarse raven, as he
                                announces Duncan’s entrance into my fortress, where he will
                                die. Come, you spirits that asist murderous thoughts, make me less
                                like a woman and more like a man, and fill me from head to toe with
                                deadly cruelty! Thicken my blood and clog up my veins so I
                                won’t feel remorse, so that no human compassion can stop my
                                evil plan or prevent me from accomplishing it! Come to my female
                                breast and turn my mother’s milk into poisonous acid, you
                                murdering demons, wherever you hide, invisible and waiting to do
                                evil! Come, thick night, and cover the world in the darkest smoke of
                                hell, so that my sharp knife can’t see the wound it cuts
                                open, and so heaven can’t peep through the darkness and
                                cry, “No! Stop!”
