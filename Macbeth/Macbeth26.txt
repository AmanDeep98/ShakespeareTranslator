Your only duty,
                                your highness, is to accept what we owe you. Our duty to you and
                                your state is like the duty of children to their father or servants
                                to their master. By doing everything we can to protect you,
                                we’re only doing what we should.You are welcome here. By making you thane of Cawdor, I have
                                planted the seeds of a great career for you, and I will make sure
                                they grow. (to BANQUO) Noble Banquo, you deserve no less than
                                Macbeth, and everyone should know it. Let me bring you close to me
                                and give you the benefit of my love and good will.Then if I accomplish anything great, it will be a credit to
                            you.My joy is so overwhelming it brings tears to my eyes. My sons,
                                relatives, lords, and all those closest to me, I want you to witness
                                that I will bestow my kingdom on my eldest son, Malcolm. Today I
                                name him the prince of Cumberland. But Malcolm isn’t going
                                to be alone in receiving honors—titles of nobility will
                                shine like stars on all of you who deserve them. (to MACBETH) And now, let’s go to your castle at Inverness,
                                where I will become even more obliged to you because of your
                                hospitality.I’m not happy unless I can be working for you. I will go
                                ahead and bring my wife the good news that you are coming. With
                                that, I’ll be off.My worthy Cawdor!
