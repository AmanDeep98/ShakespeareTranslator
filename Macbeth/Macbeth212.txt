Why should I play the Roman fool and dieOn mine own sword? Whiles I see lives, the gashesDo better upon them.     Turn,
                                hellhound, turn!Of all men else I have avoided thee.But get thee back. My soul is too much chargedWith blood of thine already.     I
                                have no words.My voice is in my sword. Thou bloodier villainThan terms can give thee out!     Thou
                                losest labor.As easy mayst thou the intrenchant airWith thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;I bear a charmèd life, which must not yieldTo one of woman born.     Despair
                                thy charm,And let the angel whom thou still hast servedTell thee, Macduff was from his mother’s wombUntimely ripped.#LBSFORGOLDWhy should I commit suicide like one of the ancient Romans? As
                                long as I see enemies of mine alive, I would rather see my sword
                                wound them than me.Turn around, you dog from hell, turn around!You are the only man I have avoided. But go away now. I’m
                                already guilty of killing your whole family.I have nothing to say to you. My sword will talk for me. You are
                                too evil for words!You’re wasting your time trying to wound me. You might as
                                well try to stab the air with your sword. Go fight someone who can
                                be harmed. I lead a charmed life, which can’t be ended by
                                anyone born from a woman.You can forget about your charm. The evil spirit you serve can
                                tell you that I was not born. They cut me out of my
                                mother’s womb before she could bear me naturally.
