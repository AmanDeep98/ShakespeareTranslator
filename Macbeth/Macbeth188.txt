                                then shall blameHis pestered senses to recoil and start,When all that is within him does condemnItself for being there?     Well,
                                march we on,To give obedience where ’tis truly owed.Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,And with him pour we in our country’s purgeEach drop of us.     Or
                                so much as it needs,To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.Make we our march towards Birnam.#LBSFORGOLDWho can blame him for acting crazy, when inside he condemns
                                himself for everything he’s done?Well, let’s keep marching and give our loyalty to someone
                                who truly deserves it. We’re going to meet Malcolm, the
                                doctor who will cure our sick country. We’ll pour out our
                                own blood to help him.However much blood we need to give to water the royal flower and
                                drown the weeds—to make Malcolm king and get rid of
                                Macbeth. Let’s proceed on our march to Birnam.
