     I
                                am one, my liege,Whom the vile blows and buffets of the worldHave so incensed that I am reckless whatI do to spite the world.And I anotherSo weary with disasters, tugged with fortune,That I would set my life on any chance,To mend it or be rid on ’t.     Both
                                of youKnow Banquo was your enemy.     True,
                                my lord.So is he mine; and in such bloody distanceThat every minute of his being thrustsAgainst my near’st of life. And though I couldWith barefaced power sweep him from my sightAnd bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,For certain friends that are both his and mine,Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fallWho I myself struck down. And thence it is,That I to your assistance do make love,Masking the business from the common eyeFor sundry weighty reasons.#LBSFORGOLDMy lord, I’ve been so kicked around by the world, and
                                I’m so angry, that I don’t even care what I
                            do.I’m the same. I’m so sick of bad luck and
                                trouble that I’d risk my life on any bet, as long as it
                                would either fix my life or end it once and for all.You both know Banquo was your enemy.It’s true, my lord.He’s my enemy too, and I hate him so much that every
                                minute he’s alive it eats away at my heart. Since
                                I’m king, I could simply use my power to get rid of him.
                                But I can’t do that, because he and I have friends in
                                common whom I need, so I have to be able to moan and cry over his
                                death in public even though I’ll be the one who had him
                                killed. That’s why I need your help right now. I have to
                                hide my real plans from the public eye for many important
                            reasons.
