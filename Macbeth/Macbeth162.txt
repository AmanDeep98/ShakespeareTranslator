With this there growsIn my most ill-composed affection suchA stanchless avarice that, were I king,I should cut off the nobles for their lands,Desire his jewels and this other’s house.And my more-having would be as a sauceTo make me hunger more, that I should forgeQuarrels unjust against the good and loyal,Destroying them for wealth.     This
                                avariceSticks deeper, grows with more pernicious rootThan summer-seeming lust, and it hath beenThe sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear;Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will,Of your mere own. All these are portable,With other graces weighed.But I have none. The king-becoming graces,As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,I have no relish of them but aboundIn the division of each several crime,Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I shouldPour the sweet milk of concord into hell,Uproar the universal peace, confoundAll unity on earth.     O
                                Scotland, Scotland!If such a one be fit to govern, speak.I am as I have spoken.#LBSFORGOLDAlong with being full of lust, I’m also incredibly
                                greedy. If I became king, I would steal the nobles' lands,
                                taking jewels from one guy and houses from another. The more I had,
                                the greedier I would grow, until I’d invent false quarrels
                                with my good and loyal subjects, destroying them so I could get my
                                hands on their wealth.The greed you’re talking about is worse than lust because
                                you won’t outgrow it. Greed has been the downfall of many
                                kings. But don’t be afraid. Scotland has enough treasures
                                to satisfy you out of your own royal coffers. These bad qualities
                                are bearable when balanced against your good sides.But I don’t have any good sides. I don’t have a
                                trace of the qualities a king needs, such as justice, truth,
                                moderation, stability, generosity, perseverance, mercy, humility,
                                devotion, patience, courage, and bravery. Instead, I overflow with
                                every variation of all the different vices. No, if I had power I
                                would take world peace and throw it down to hell.Oh Scotland, Scotland!If someone like me is fit to be king, let me know. I really am
                                exactly as I have described myself to you.
