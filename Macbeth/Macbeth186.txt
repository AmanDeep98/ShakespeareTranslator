The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,His uncle Siward and the good Macduff.Revenges burn in them, for their dear causesWould to the bleeding and the grim alarmExcite the mortified man.     Near
                                Birnam WoodShall we well meet them; that way are they coming.Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?For certain, sir, he is not. I have a fileOf all the gentry. There is Siward’s son,And many unrough youths that even nowProtest their first of manhood.     What
                                does the tyrant?Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.Some say he’s mad, others that lesser hate himDo call it valiant fury. But, for certain,He cannot buckle his distempered causeWithin the belt of rule.     Now
                                does he feelHis secret murders sticking on his hands.Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach.Those he commands move only in command,Nothing in love. Now does he feel his titleHang loose about him, like a giant’s robeUpon a dwarfish thief.#LBSFORGOLDThe English army is near, led by Malcolm, his uncle Siward, and
                                the good Macduff. They burn for revenge. The wrongs they have
                                suffered would make dead men rise up and fight.We’ll meet them near Birnam Wood. They are coming that
                                way.Does anyone know if Donalbain is with his brother?He is definitely not there, sir. I have a list of all the
                                important men. Siward’s son is there, as well as many boys
                                too young to have beards who will become men by joining in this
                                battle.What is the tyrant Macbeth doing?He is fortifying his castle at Dunsinane with heavy defenses. Some
                                say he’s insane. Those who hate him less call it brave
                                anger. One thing is certain: he’s out of control.Now Macbeth feels the blood of his murdered enemies sticking to
                                his hands. Now, rebel armies punish him every minute for his
                                treachery. The soldiers he commands are only following orders. They
                                don’t fight because they love Macbeth. Now he seems too
                                small to be a great king, like a midget trying to wear the robes of
                                a giant.
