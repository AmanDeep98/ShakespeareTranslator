                                tune goes manly.Come, go we to the king. Our power is ready;Our lack is nothing but our leave. MacbethIs ripe for shaking, and the powers abovePut on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may.The night is long that never finds the day.#LBSFORGOLDNow you sound like a man. Come on, let’s go see King
                                Edward. The army is ready. All we have to do now is say goodbye to
                                the king. Macbeth is ripe for the picking. We’ll be acting
                                as God’s agents. Cheer up as much as you can. A new day
                                will come at last.
