(aside) The prince of Cumberland!
                                That is a stepOn which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;Let not light see my black and deep desires.The eye wink at the hand, yet let that beWhich the eye fears, when it is done, to see.True, worthy Banquo. He is full so valiant,And in his commendations I am fed;It is a banquet to me.—Let’s after him,Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:It is a peerless kinsman.#LBSFORGOLD
(to himself) Malcolm is now the
                                prince of Cumberland! To become king myself, I’m either
                                going to have to step over him or give up, because he’s in
                                my way. Stars, hide your light so no one can see the terrible
                                desires within me. I won’t let my eye look at what my hand
                                is doing, but in the end I’m still going to do that thing
                                I’d be horrified to see.
(to BANQUO,
                                    in the middle of a conversation we haven’t
                                heard) You’re right, Banquo. Macbeth is every bit
                                as valiant as you say, and I am satisfied with these praises of him.
                                Let’s follow after him, now that he has gone ahead to
                                prepare our welcome. He is a man without equal.
