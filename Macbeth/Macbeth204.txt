                                thou speak’st false,Upon the next tree shall thou hang aliveTill famine cling thee. If thy speech be sooth,I care not if thou dost for me as much.I pull in resolution and beginTo doubt th' equivocation of the fiendThat lies like truth. “Fear not, till Birnam woodDo come to Dunsinane”; and now a woodComes toward Dunsinane.—Arm, arm, and
                                out!—If this which he avouches does appear,There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.I 'gin to be aweary of the sun,And wish th' estate o' th' world were
                                now undone.—Ring the alarum-bell!—Blow, wind! Come, wrack!At least we’ll die with harness on our back.#LBSFORGOLDIf you’re lying, I’ll hang you alive from the
                                nearest tree until you die of hunger. If what you say is true, you
                                can do the same to me. (to himself)
                                My confidence is failing. I’m starting to doubt the lies
                                the devil told me, which sounded like truth.
                                “Don’t worry until Birnam Wood comes to
                                Dunsinane.” And now a wood is coming to Dunsinane.
                                Prepare for battle, and go! If what this messenger says is true,
                                it’s no use running away or staying here. I’m
                                starting to grow tired of living, and I’d like to see the
                                world plunged into chaos. Ring the alarms! Blow, wind! Come, ruin!
                                At least we’ll die with our armor on.
