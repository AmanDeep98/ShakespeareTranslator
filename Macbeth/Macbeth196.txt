Cousins, I hope the days are near at handThat chambers will be safe.     We
                                doubt it nothing.What wood is this before us?     The
                                wood of Birnam.Let every soldier hew him down a boughAnd bear ’t before him. Thereby shall we shadowThe numbers of our host and make discoveryErr in report of us.     It
                                shall be done.We learn no other but the confident tyrantKeeps still in Dunsinane and will endureOur setting down before ’t.     'Tis
                                his main hope:For, where there is advantage to be given,Both more and less have given him the revolt,And none serve with him but constrainèd thingsWhose hearts are absent too.     Let
                                our just censuresAttend the true event, and put we onIndustrious soldiership.#LBSFORGOLDKinsmen, I hope the time is coming when people will be safe in
                                their own bedrooms.We don’t doubt it.What’s the name of this forest behind us?Birnam Wood.Tell every soldier to break off a branch and hold it in front of
                                him. That way we can conceal how many of us there are, and
                                Macbeth’s spies will give him inaccurate reports.We’ll do it.We have no news except that the overconfident Macbeth is still in
                                Dunsinane and will allow us to lay siege to the castle.He wants us to lay siege. Wherever his soldiers have an
                                opportunity to leave him, they do, whatever rank they are. No one
                                fights with him except men who are forced to, and their hearts
                                aren’t in it.We shouldn’t make any judgments until we achieve our
                                goal. Let’s go fight like hardworking soldiers.
