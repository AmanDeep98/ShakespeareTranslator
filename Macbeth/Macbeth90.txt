Now go to the door and stay there till we call.Was it not yesterday we spoke together?It was, so please your highness.     Well
                                then, nowHave you considered of my speeches? KnowThat it was he, in the times past, which held youSo under fortune, which you thought had beenOur innocent self. This I made good to youIn our last conference, passed in probation with you,How you were borne in hand, how crossed, the instruments,Who wrought with them, and all things else that mightTo half a soul and to a notion crazedSay, “Thus did Banquo.”     You
                                made it known to us.I did so, and went further, which is nowOur point of second meeting. Do you findYour patience so predominant in your natureThat you can let this go? Are you so gospeledTo pray for this good man and for his issue,Whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the graveAnd beggared yours forever?     We
                                are men, my liege.Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men,As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are cleptAll by the name of dogs. The valued fileDistinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,The housekeeper, the hunter, every oneAccording to the gift which bounteous natureHath in him closed, whereby he does receiveParticular addition, from the billThat writes them all alike. And so of men.Now, if you have a station in the file,Not i' th' worst rank of manhood, say
                                ’t,And I will put that business in your bosoms,Whose execution takes your enemy off,Grapples you to the heart and love of us,Who wear our health but sickly in his life,Which in his death were perfect.#LBSFORGOLDNow go to the door and stay there until I call for you.Wasn’t it just yesterday that we spoke to each
                            other?It was yesterday, your highness.Well, did you think about what I said? You should know that it was
                                Banquo who made your lives hell for so long, which you always
                                thought was my fault. But I was innocent. I showed you the proof at
                                our last meeting. I explained how you were deceived, how you were
                                thwarted, the things that were used against you, who was working
                                against you, and a lot of other things that would convince even a
                                half-wit or a crazy person to say, “Banquo did
                                it!”You explained it all.I did that and more, which brings me to the point of this second
                                meeting. Are you so patient and forgiving that you’re going
                                to let him off the hook? Are you so pious that you would pray for
                                this man and his children, a man who has pushed you toward an early
                                grave and put your family in poverty forever?We are men, my lord.Yes, you’re part of the species called men. Just as
                                hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, mutts, shaggy lapdogs,
                                swimming dogs, and wolf-dog crossbreeds are all dogs. But if you
                                list the different kinds of dogs according to their qualities, you
                                can distinguish which breeds are fast or slow, which ones are
                                clever, which ones are watchdogs, and which ones hunters. You can
                                classify each dog according to the natural gifts that separate it
                                from all other dogs. It’s the same with men. Now, if you
                                occupy some place in the list of men that isn’t down at the
                                very bottom, tell me. Because if that’s the case, I will
                                tell you a plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you closer
                                to me. As long as Banquo lives, I am sick. I’ll be healthy
                                when he is dead.
