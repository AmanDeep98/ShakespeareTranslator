     Who
                                dares receive it other,As we shall make our griefs and clamor roarUpon his death?     I
                                am settled, and bend upEach corporal agent to this terrible feat.Away, and mock the time with fairest show.False face must hide what the false heart doth know.#LBSFORGOLDWho could think it happened any other way? We’ll be
                                grieving loudly when we hear that Duncan has died.Now I’m decided, and I will exert every muscle in my body
                                to commit this crime. Go now, and pretend to be a friendly hostess.
                                Hide with a false pleasant face what you know in your false, evil
                                heart.
