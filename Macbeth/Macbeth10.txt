Where hast thou been, sister?Killing swine.Sister, where thou?A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap,And munched, and munched, and munched. “Give

                                at them. “Give me one,” I said.
                                “Get away from me, witch!” the fat woman
                                cried. Her husband has sailed off to Aleppo as master of a ship
                                called the Tiger. I’ll sail
                                there in a kitchen strainer, turn myself into a tailless rat, and do
                                things to him—I’ll give you some wind to sail there.How nice of you!And I will give you some more.I already have control of all the other winds, along with the
                                ports from which they blow and every direction on the
                                sailor’s compass in which they can go. I’ll drain
                                the life out of him. He won’t catch a wink of sleep, either
                                at night or during the day. He will live as a cursed man. For
                                eighty-one weeks he will waste away in agony.
