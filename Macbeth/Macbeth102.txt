But who did bid thee join with us?Macbeth.He needs not our mistrust, since he deliversOur offices and what we have to doTo the direction just.Then stand with us.The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.Now spurs the lated traveler apaceTo gain the timely inn, and near approachesThe subject of our watch.     Hark,
                                I hear horses.(within) Give us a light there,
                            ho!     Then
                                ’tis he: the restThat are within the note of expectationAlready are i' th' court.     His
                                horses go about.Almost a mile; but he does usually—So all men do—from hence to the palace gateMake it their walk.#LBSFORGOLDBut who told you to come here and join us?Macbeth.We can trust this guy. He was given exactly the same orders we
                                were.Then stay with us. There’s still a bit of daylight in the
                                sky. Now all the late travellers are hurrying to reach their inns.

                                the stables.It’s almost a mile to the palace gate, but Banquo, like
                                everybody else, usually walks from here to the palace.
