Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,As the weird women promised, and I fearThou played’st most foully for ’t. Yet it was
                                saidIt should not stand in thy posterity,But that myself should be the root and fatherOf many kings. If there come truth from them—As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine—Why, by the verities on thee made good,May they not be my oracles as well,And set me up in hope? But hush, no more.Here’s our chief guest.If he had been forgotten,It had been as a gap in our great feast,And all-thing unbecoming.Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,And I’ll request your presence.     Let
                                your highnessCommand upon me, to the which my dutiesAre with a most indissoluble tieForever knit.#LBSFORGOLDNow you have it all: you’re the king, the thane of
                                Cawdor, and the thane of Glamis, just like the weird women promised
                                you. And I suspect you cheated to win these titles. But it was also
                                prophesied that the crown would not go to your descendants, and that
                                my sons and grandsons would be kings instead. If the witches tell
                                the truth—which they did about you—maybe
                                what they said about me will come true too. But shhh! I’ll
                                shut up now.
(indicating BANQUO) Here’s
                                our most important guest.If we forgot him, our big celebration wouldn’t be
                                complete, and that wouldn’t be any good.
(to BANQUO) Tonight we’re having a ceremonial banquet, and I
                                want you to be there.Whatever your highness commands me to do, it is always my duty to
                                do it.
