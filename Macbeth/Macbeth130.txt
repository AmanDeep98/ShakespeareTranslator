Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed.Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whined.Harpier cries, “'Tis time, ’tis

And the hedgehog has whined once.My spirit friend, Harpier, is yelling, “It’s
                                time, it’s time!”Dance around the cauldron and throw in the poisoned entrails.

                                You’ll go in first—a toad that sat under a cold
                                rock for a month, oozing poison from its pores.Double, double toil and trouble,Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
(holding something up)
                                We’ll boil you in the cauldron next—a slice of
                                swamp snake. All the rest of you in too: a newt’s eye, a
                                frog’s tongue, fur from a bat, a dog’s tongue, the
                                forked tongue of an adder, the stinger of a burrowing worm, a
                                lizard’s leg, an owl’s wing. (speaking to the ingredients) Make a
                                charm to cause powerful trouble, and boil and bubble like a broth of
                                hell.Double, double toil and trouble,Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
