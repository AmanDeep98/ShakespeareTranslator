Yea, sir.Thou art a very ragged wart.Shall I prick him down, Sir John?It were superfluous, for his apparel is built upon his back,and the whole frame stands upon pins. Prick him no more.Ha, ha, ha. You can do it, sir, you can do it. I commend youwell.—Francis Feeble!Here, sir.What trade art thou, Feeble?A woman’s tailor, sir.Shall I prick him, sir?You may, but if he had been a man’s tailor, he’d ha' prickedyou.—Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy’s battle asthou hast done in a woman’s petticoat?I will do my good will, sir. You can have no more.Well said, good woman’s tailor, well said, courageousFeeble. Thou wilt be as valiant as the wrathful dove or mostmagnanimous mouse.—Prick the woman’s tailor well,Master Shallow, deep, Master Shallow.#LBSFORGOLDYup.You’re a pretty ragged wart.Should I prick him on the list, Sir John?Not necessary. For look: his clothing is just a bunch of pieces sewn together, and his whole body rests on legs as skinny as pins. He’s been pricked enough by pins and needles—don’t prick him anymore.Ha, ha, ha! You are funny, sir. You are funny. I’ve got to hand it to you. Francis Feeble!Here, sir.What kind of work do you do, Feeble?I’m a woman’s tailor, sir.Should I prick him, sir?You might as well. But if he had been a man’s tailor, he would have already pricked you with his pins. Will you make as many holes in the enemy’s armor as you have in women’s underwear?I’ll do my best, sir. I can’t do any more.Well said, good woman’s tailor! Well said, courageous Feeble! You’ll be as brave as the angriest dove or the most valiant mouse. Prick the woman’s tailor. A big one, Master Shallow; a deep one, Master Shallow.
