By 'r Lady, I think he be, but Goodman Puff of Barson.Puff?Puff in thy teeth, most recreant coward base!—Sir John, I am thy Pistol and thy friend,And helter-skelter have I rode to thee,And tidings do I bring, and lucky joys,And golden times, and happy news of price.I pray thee now, deliver them like a man of this world.A foutre for the world and worldlings base!I speak of Africa and golden joys.O base Assyrian knight, what is thy news?Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof.
(sings) And Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John.Shall dunghill curs confront the Helicons,And shall good news be baffled?Then, Pistol, lay thy head in Furies' lap.Honest gentleman, I know not your breeding.Why then, lament therefor.#LBSFORGOLDI swear, I think he is—except for the good fellow Puff, from Barson.Puff? Puff in your face, you degenerate coward! Sir John, I’m your Pistol and your friend, and I rode at full tilt to find you here. I bring you reports, and good luck, and golden times, and happy, valuable news.Then please, deliver this news like a human being who lives in this world.Damn this world, and the vile little people who live in it! I’m talking about Africa, and its golden joys.Oh, you vulgar Assyrian knight, what is your news? Convey to King CophetuaFalstaff is aping Pistol’s high-flown style. Cophetua was an African king who married a beggar.King Cophetua the story therein.

And Robin Hood, Scarlet, and Johna lyric from a popular songAnd Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John.Will junkyard dogs attack the Muses, goddesses of poetry? Will my good news be thwarted this way? Then Pistol, go ahead and plead with the Furies, the goddesses of revenge.Honest gentleman, I don’t know what kind of family you’re from.That’s your loss.
