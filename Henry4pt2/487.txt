Upon thy sightMy worldly business makes a period.Where is my Lord of Warwick?My Lord of Warwick.Doth any name particular belongUnto the lodging where I first did swoon?'Tis called Jerusalem, my noble lord.Laud be to God! Even there my life must end.It hath been prophesied to me many years,I should not die but in Jerusalem,Which vainly I supposed the Holy Land.But bear me to that chamber; there I’ll lie.In that Jerusalem shall Harry die.#LBSFORGOLDand lawful. And I will work as hard as I can to defend this crown against any man.Look, look, here comes my son, John of Lancaster.Health, peace, and happiness to my royal father!You bring me happiness and peace, John. But health, unfortunately, has flown from this shrunken body. Now that I’ve seen you, I have nothing more to do in this world. Where is Lord Warwick?Lord Warwick!Does the room I first collapsed in have a name?It’s called the Jerusalem Room, your highness.Praise be to God! That’s where I must die. For years it’s been predicted that I would die in Jerusalem; I foolishly thought that meant the Holy Land. But carry me to that room, and there I’ll lie. In that Jerusalem will Harry die.
