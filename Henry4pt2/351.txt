What the devil hast thou brought there—applejohns? Thouknowest Sir John cannot endure an applejohn.Mass, thou sayest true. The Prince once set a dish ofapplejohns before him and told him there were five more SirJohns and, putting off his hat, said “I will now take my leaveof these six dry, round, old, withered knights.” It angeredhim to the heart. But he hath forgot that.Why then, cover, and set them down, and see if thou canstfind out Sneak’s noise. Mistress Tearsheet would fain hearsome music.Dispatch: the room where they supped is too hot. They’llcome in straight.Sirrah, here will be the Prince and Master Poins anon, andthey will put on two of our jerkins and aprons, and Sir Johnmust not know of it. Bardolph hath brought word.By the Mass, here will be old utis. It will be an excellentstratagem.I’ll see if I can find out Sneak.#LBSFORGOLDWhat the hell have you got there? Apple johnsapple johns = a variety of apple, eaten once the fruit is shriveledApple johns? You know Sir John can’t stand apple johns.Damn, you’re right. One day the Prince put a plate of apple-johns in front of Falstaff and said, “Here are five more Sir Johns.” Then the Prince took off his hat and said, “I’m now going to bid farewell to these six dry, round, old, withered knights.” It angered Sir John deeply, but he got over it.Well then, put the table cloth on and set the dish down. Go see if you can find Sneak’s band of musicians. Mistress Tearsheet wants to hear some music.Hurry! The room they ate in was too hot, and they’ll be here any minute.Sirrah, the Prince and Poins will be here soon. They’re going to put on a couple of our jackets and aprons. Sir John can’t know it’s them. Bardolph came and told me.Well, there’s going to be hilarity here! What a great scheme!I’ll see if I can find Sneak.
