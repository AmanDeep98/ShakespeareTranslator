Who knocks so loud at door? Look to th' door there, Francis.Peto, how now, what news?The King your father is at Westminster,And there are twenty weak and wearied postsCome from the north, and as I came alongI met and overtook a dozen captains,Bareheaded, sweating, knocking at the tavernsAnd asking everyone for Sir John Falstaff.By heaven, Poins, I feel me much to blameSo idly to profane the precious timeWhen tempest of commotion, like the southBorne with black vapour, doth begin to meltAnd drop upon our bare unarmèd heads.—Give me my sword and cloak.—Falstaff, good night.Now comes in the sweetest morsel of the night, and we must hence and leave it unpicked.More knocking at the door?How now, what’s the matter?#LBSFORGOLDWho’s knocking so loudly on the door? Francis, go see.Peto, how are you? What’s going on?Your father the King is in Westminster. Twenty exhausted messengers have arrived from the north. And, on my way here, I met a dozen captains, hustling and working hard, knocking on the door of every tavern and searching for Sir John Falstaff.My God, Poins, I feel terrible wasting precious time on this idleness when a huge black storm is brewing, soon to open up on our bare, vulnerable heads. Give me my coat and my sword. Good night, Falstaff.Now’s the sweetest part of the night, and we have to leave without enjoying it.More knocking!What’s going on? What’s the matter?
