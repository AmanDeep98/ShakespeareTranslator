'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeedIt was young Hotspur’s cause at Shrewsbury.It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,Eating the air on promise of supply,Flatt'ring himself in project of a powerMuch smaller than the smallest of his thoughts,And so, with great imaginationProper to madmen, led his powers to deathAnd, winking, leapt into destruction.But, by your leave, it never yet did hurtTo lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.Yes, if this present quality of war—Indeed the instant action, a cause on foot—Lives so in hope, as in an early springWe see the appearing buds, which to prove fruitHope gives not so much warrant as despairThat frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,We first survey the plot, then draw the model,And when we see the figure of the house,Then must we rate the cost of the erection,Which if we find outweighs ability,What do we then but draw anew the modelIn fewer offices, or at last desistTo build at all? Much more in this great work,Which is almost to pluck a kingdom downAnd set another up, should we surveyThe plot of situation and the model,Consent upon a sure foundation,Question surveyors, know our own estate,How able such a work to undergo,To weigh against his opposite. Or else#LBSFORGOLDThat’s right, Lord Bardolph. That’s what happened to young Hotspur at Shrewsbury.That’s true, my lord. Hotspur fortified himself with nothing but hope, and mistook empty words as a true promise of reinforcements. He imagined that a huge army was coming to his aid, but what actually arrived turned out to be even smaller than the smallest of his fantasies. And so, with daydreams that could only belong to a madman, he closed his eyes and leaped into destruction.But, begging your pardon, there’s no harm in making guesses and hopeful strategies.Yes, there is. Presently, our armies are already in motion, but putting our hope in them is as ridiculous as expecting that early spring buds will produce fruit: at that time of year, buds are more likely to be killed by frost than to bloom. When we want to put up a building, first we survey the land, and then we draw up a set of plans. Then we calculate the cost, and if we can’t afford it, we revise the plans with fewer rooms, or we decide not to build at all. In the great task we’re attempting—the taking down of one kingdom, and the building of another—we have even more reason to evaluate the land and the plans. We must be certain that the foundation is sound, that the engineer is skilled. We must know precisely what we can afford, how ready and able we are, and we must consider the opposing arguments.
