What’s your name, sir? Of what condition are you, and ofwhat place, I pray?I am a knight, sir, and my name is Colevile of the Dale.Well, then, Colevile is your name, a knight is your degree,and your place the Dale. Colevile shall be still your name, atraitor your degree, and the dungeon your place, a place deepenough so shall you be still Colevile of the Dale.Are not you Sir John Falstaff?As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do ye yield, sir, orshall I sweat for you? If I do sweat, they are the drops of thylovers and they weep for thy death. Therefore rouse up fearand trembling, and do observance to my mercy.I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that thought yieldme.I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of mine, and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name. An I had but a belly of any indifferency, I were simply the most active fellow in Europe. My womb, my womb, my womb undoes me. Here comes our general.#LBSFORGOLDWhat’s your name, sir? What’s your rank, and where are you from?I am a knight, sir. My name is Coleville of the Valley.Well, then, Coleville is your name, your rank is knight, and the valley is where you’re from. Coleville will still be your name now that “traitor” is your rank, and the dungeon is where you’ll be. It’s a place so deep that you’ll still be in a kind of valley.Aren’t you Sir John Falstaff?I’m as good a man as Falstaff, whoever I am. Will you surrender? Or am I going to have to break a sweat making you surrender? If I sweat, the drops will be the tears of your loved ones, weeping over your death. So you’d better get scared and start to shake, and start praying to me for mercy.I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and so I surrender.My enormous belly can speak in many languages, and each language proclaims my name and my name alone. If I had a moderately sized belly, all I’d be is an anonymous but very successful soldier. But my belly, my belly, my belly blows my cover. Here comes the general.
