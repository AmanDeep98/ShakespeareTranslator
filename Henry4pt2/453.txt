like gilt twopences to me, and I in the clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full moon doth the cinders of the element (which show like pins' heads to her), believe not the word of the noble. Therefore let me have right, and let desert mount.Thine’s too heavy to mount.Let it shine, then.Thine’s too thick to shine.Let it do something, my good lord, that may do me good, andcall it what you will.Is thy name Colevile?   It is, my lord.A famous rebel art thou, Colevile.And a famous true subject took him.I am, my lord, but as my betters areThat led me hither. Had they been ruled by me,You should have won them dearer than you have.I know not how they sold themselves, but thou, like a kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis, and I thank thee for thee.Now, have you left pursuit?#LBSFORGOLDdon’t make you look like counterfeits next to me, and if my fame doesn’t outshine yours like the full moon outshines the stars (which look like pin pricks in the sky next to the moon)—well then, you can call me a liar. Now give me what I deserve, and let my merits mount on top of each other, in a great pile.Your pile would be too heavy for me to bear.Let my merits shine, then.You’re too dense to shine.Then let it do something that will do me good, whatever you want to call it.Is your name Coleville?It is, sir.You’re a famous rebel, Coleville.And a famous and loyal subject captured him.I’m now in the same situation as my superiors, who led me here. But if I had been in charge, your victory would have cost you more than it has.I don’t know how much your superiors cost us, but you, like a generous man, gave yourself away for free, and I thank you for it.Have you called off the troops?
