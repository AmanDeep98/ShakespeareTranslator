Now, lords, if God doth give successful endTo this debate that bleedeth at our doors,We will our youth lead on to higher fieldsAnd draw no swords but what are sanctified.Our navy is addressed, our power collected,Our substitutes in absence well invested,And everything lies level to our wish.Only we want a little personal strength;And pause us till these rebels now afootCome underneath the yoke of government.Both which we doubt not but your MajestyShall soon enjoy.   Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,Where is the Prince your brother?I think he’s gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.And how accompanied?   I do not know, my lord.Is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him?No, my good lord, he is in presence here.What would my lord and father?#LBSFORGOLDNow, my lords: if God grants us a victory in this violent civil war that bleeds at our very doorsteps, I will lead our young people in a greater cause, and fight nothing but holy wars. Our navy is ready, our army is assembled, the leaders who are my subordinates have their orders, and everything is standing by to achieve my main aim. The only drawback is that I’m feeling a little weak. So let’s wait a short while, until the rebels, now on the run, are brought back in line and are made obedient again.We are sure that you’ll soon enjoy both good health and the rebels' defeat.My son Humphrey of Gloucester, where is your brother, Prince Hal?I think he’s gone hunting at Windsor.Who’s with him?I don’t know, father.Isn’t his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?No, father. He’s here.What is it you’d like, father?
