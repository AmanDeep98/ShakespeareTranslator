That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,We shall be winnowed with so rough a windThat even our corn shall seem as light as chaffAnd good from bad find no partition.No, no, my lord. Note this: the King is wearyOf dainty and such picking grievances,For he hath found to end one doubt by deathRevives two greater in the heirs of life;And therefore will he wipe his tables cleanAnd keep no telltale to his memoryThat may repeat and history his lossTo new remembrance. For full well he knowsHe cannot so precisely weed this landAs his misdoubts present occasion;His foes are so enrooted with his friendsThat, plucking to unfix an enemy,He doth unfasten so and shake a friend;So that this land, like an offensive wifeThat hath enraged him on to offer strokes,As he is striking holds his infant upAnd hangs resolved correction in the armThat was upreared to execution.Besides, the King hath wasted all his rodsOn late offenders, that he now doth lackThe very instruments of chastisement,So that his power, like to a fangless lion,May offer but not hold.   'Tis very true,And therefore be assured, my good Lord Marshal,If we do now make our atonement well,Our peace will, like a broken limb united,Grow stronger for the breaking.#LBSFORGOLDwon’t count; he won’t be able to distinguish them from the bad.No, no, sir. Listen, the king is tired of getting upset over every little thing. He’s discovered that ending one problem by killing someone only creates two bigger problems in the people left alive. So from now on, he’ll wipe his memory clean, and forget anything that might remind him of the bad things from his past. He knows that he can’t just eliminate every single opponent who crops up.His enemies are rooted in with his friends, to the extent that, if he tries to pull up an enemy, he’ll also uproot and discard a friend. This country’s like a misbehaving wife, who, just when her husband is about to hit her, holds his baby up, and freezes the intended punishment in the very arm that was poised to apply it.Besides, the King has expended all his energy for punishment on the recent rebellion. He has nothing left to punish with. His power is like a lion with no teeth: it can threaten, but it can’t do any harm.That’s true. Rest assured, my good Lord Marshal, if our reconciliation is sincere, then peace will be like a broken bone, which grows stronger for having once been broken.
