O God, I fear all will be overturned.Good morrow, cousin Warwick, good morrow.Good morrow, cousin.We meet like men that had forgot to speak.We do remember, but our argumentIs all too heavy to admit much talk.Well, peace be with him that hath made us heavy.Peace be with us, lest we be heavier.O, good my lord, you have lost a friend indeed,And I dare swear you borrow not that faceOf seeming sorrow; it is sure your own.Though no man be assured what grace to find,You stand in coldest expectation.I am the sorrier; would ’twere otherwise.Well, you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair,Which swims against your stream of quality.Sweet princes, what I did I did in honor,Led by th' impartial conduct of my soul;And never shall you see that I will begA ragged and forestalled remission.If truth and upright innocency fail me,I’ll to the King my master that is deadAnd tell him who hath sent me after him.#LBSFORGOLDOh God! I’m afraid everything will be turned upside-down.Good morning, cousin Warwick, good morning.Good morning, cousin.We’re all like men who don’t remember how to speak.We remember how, but what we have to say is so sad that we cannot speak.Well, peace be with the man who has made us sad.Peace be with us, or else we’ll be even sadder!Oh, my good lord, you’ve lost a friend, indeed. I’m sure you’re not borrowing that sorrowful face; it’s certainly your own.Even though no man can know what blessings will come his way, he must expect the worst. I am sorry; I wish it were otherwise.Well, now you are only allowed to speak well of Sir John Falstaff, which goes against the nature of a man of your quality.Sweet princes, what I did, I did honorably, impartially, and with a clear conscience. You won’t see me begging vilely for a pardon, which is sure to be withdrawn as soon as it is given. If truth and honest innocence don’t help me, then I’ll join my dead King and tell him who sent me.
