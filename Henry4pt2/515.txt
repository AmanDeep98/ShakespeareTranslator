(sings) Do me right,And dub me knight,Samingo.Is ’t not so?'Tis so.Is ’t so? Why then, say an old man can do somewhat.An ’t please your Worship, there’s one Pistol come from thecourt with news.From the court? Let him come in.How now, Pistol?Sir John, God save you.What wind blew you hither, Pistol?Not the ill wind which blows no man to good. Sweet knight,   thou art now one of the greatest men in this realm.#LBSFORGOLD
(to SILENCE) You’re really keeping up with me!
(sings) Keep up with me,Then dub me a knight!
SamingoSamingo = lyric from “Monsieur Mingo,” a drinking song. In Latin, mingo means “I urinate.”Samingo!Right?Right.Right? Then you’ve got to admit that an old man can do some things.Sir, if I may say so, there’s someone named Pistol here from the royal court. He’s got news.From the royal court? Let him in.What’s up, Pistol!God save you, Sir John.What wind blew you here, Pistol?Not the evil wind that blows no one toward any good. Sweet knight, you are now one of the hugest men in the country.
