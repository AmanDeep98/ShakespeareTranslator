   Now, what news?West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,In goodly form comes on the enemy,And, by the ground they hide, I judge their numberUpon or near the rate of thirty thousand.The just proportion that we gave them out.Let us sway on and face them in the field.What well-appointed leader fronts us here?I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.Health and fair greeting from our general,The Prince Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace,What doth concern your coming.   Then, my lord,Unto your Grace do I in chief addressThe substance of my speech. If that rebellionCame like itself, in base and abject routs,Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rage,And countenanced by boys and beggary—I say, if damn’d commotion so appearedIn his true, native, and most proper shape,You, reverend father, and these noble lordsHad not been here to dress the ugly formOf base and bloody insurrection#LBSFORGOLDWhat’s happening?The enemy is west of this forest, and less than a mile away. They look powerful, and, from the amount of space they’re taking up, I’d say they have close to thirty thousand soldiers.That’s exactly the number we thought they had. Let’s march ahead and engage them in battle.Who’s this well-equipped leader coming here to confront us?I think it’s Lord Westmoreland.Our general, the Prince Lord John of Lancaster, sends greetings and wishes you good health.Speak in peace, Lord Westmoreland. What’s the reason you’ve come here?The most important part of my message is for you, your grace. You, who are a holy man, and these good gentlemen as well—you would not be here, lending dignity to this bloody insurrection, if it appeared as rebellion normally does: like a lowborn mob, led by bloody youths uniformed in rags, and supported by boys and beggars.
