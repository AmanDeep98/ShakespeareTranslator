My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turned me backWith joyful tidings and, being better horsed,Outrode me. After him came spurring hardA gentleman, almost forspent with speed,That stopp’d by me to breathe his bloodied horse.He asked the way to Chester, and of himI did demand what news from Shrewsbury.He told me that rebellion had bad luckAnd that young Harry Percy’s spur was cold.With that he gave his able horse the headAnd, bending forward, struck his armèd heelsAgainst the panting sides of his poor jadeUp to the rowel-head, and starting soHe seemed in running to devour the way,Staying no longer question.   Ha? Again:Said he young Harry Percy’s spur was cold?Of Hotspur, Coldspur? That rebellionHad met ill luck?   My lord, I’ll tell you what:If my young lord your son have not the day,Upon mine honor, for a silken pointI’ll give my barony. Never talk of it.Why should that gentleman that rode by TraversGive then such instances of loss?   Who, he?He was some hilding fellow that had stolenThe horse he rode on and, upon my life,Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.#LBSFORGOLDSir, LordMany critics believe that the “Sir John Umfrevile” in Shakespeare’s text is a textual error, an accidental leftover from an early draft, and that Travers is actually referring to Bardolph.Lord Bardolph told me happy news and I turned around, to come back here. But he had a faster horse, so he passed me and got here first. Another man came after him, riding hard. He was nearly exhausted from going so fast, and he stopped to give his bleeding horse a break. He asked me for directions to Chester, and I demanded to hear news from Shrewsbury. He said that the rebels had been beaten, and that Harry Percy’s spur was cold. Then he took off on his horse, leaned forward in his saddle, and jammed his heels into the animal’s side so hard that they almost disappeared. He rode so fast he seemed to be devouring the highway. He didn’t stay around to answer any of my questions.What? Say that again: he said that Harry Percy’s spur was cold? Hotspur is now “Coldspur?” That the rebels had bad luck?My lord, I’ll tell you what—if your son hasn’t won, on my honor, I’ll exchange all my land for a lace to tie stockings with; don’t even say such a thing.But why would that gentleman who rode past Travers describe such examples of loss?Who, him? He was some insignificant nobody who stole the horse he was riding and, I bet my life, was just talking nonsense. Look, here comes another messenger.
