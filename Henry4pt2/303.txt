A pox of this gout! Or, a gout of this pox, for the one or theother plays the rogue with my great toe. 'Tis no matter if Ido halt. I have the wars for my color, and my pension shallseem the more reasonable. A good wit will make use ofanything. I will turn diseases to commodity.#LBSFORGOLDDamn this gout! Or damn this syphilis! One of them is really messing up my big toe. Oh well, it doesn’t matter if I limp. I can blame it on the war, and that will help justify my disability payments. A sharp brain can turn any problem to its advantage. I’ll turn my diseases into cash.
