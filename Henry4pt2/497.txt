How now, my Lord Chief Justice, whither away?How doth the King?Exceeding well. His cares are now all ended.I hope, not dead.   He’s walked the way of nature,And to our purposes he lives no more.I would his Majesty had called me with him.The service that I truly did his lifeHath left me open to all injuries.Indeed, I think the young King loves you not.I know he doth not, and do arm myselfTo welcome the condition of the time,Which cannot look more hideously upon meThan I have drawn it in my fantasy.Here come the heavy issue of dead Harry.O, that the living Harry had the temperOf he the worst of these three gentlemen!How many nobles then should hold their placesThat must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!#LBSFORGOLDWhat’s happening, my Lord Chief Justice? Where are you going?How’s the King doing?Very well. All his worries are ended now.Not dead, I hope.He’s gone down nature’s path; for our purposes, he is no longer living.I wish his majesty had brought me with him. The work I did for him while he was alive makes me very vulnerable, now that he’s dead.Indeed, I think the young King has no love for you.I know he doesn’t. I’m preparing myself to deal with whatever happens, which can’t be any worse than what I’ve imagined.Here come the heavy-hearted children of dead Harry. If only the living Harry had the character of the worst of these three young men. Then a lot of noblemen would remain secure, instead of having to step aside to make room for lowlifes.
