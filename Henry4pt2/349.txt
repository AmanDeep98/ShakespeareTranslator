To rain upon remembrance with mine eyesThat it may grow and sprout as high as heavenFor recordation to my noble husband.Come, come, go in with me. 'Tis with my mindAs with the tide swelled up unto his height,That makes a still-stand, running neither way.Fain would I go to meet the Archbishop,But many thousand reasons hold me back.I will resolve for Scotland. There am ITill time and vantage crave my company.#LBSFORGOLDthe plant of remembrance, it will never grow tall enough to pay proper tribute to my extraordinary husband.Come. Come. Go inside with me. My thoughts are like the ocean at high tide—neither coming in nor going out, seeming to stand still. I want to go join the Archbishop, but many thousands of reasons are holding me back. I’ll go to Scotland and wait there till events unfold and my help is called for.
