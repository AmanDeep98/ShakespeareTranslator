I sent for you, when there were matters against you for yourlife, to come speak with me.As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws ofthis land-service, I did not come.Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less.Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.I would it were otherwise. I would my means were greaterand my waist slender.You have misled the youthful Prince.The young Prince hath misled me. I am the fellow with thegreat belly, and he my dog.Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound. Your day’sservice at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your night’sexploit on Gad’s HillThe robbery at Gad’s Hill occurs in Henry IV, Part One.Gad’s Hill. You may thank th' unquiet time foryour quiet o'erposting that action.My lord.But since all is well, keep it so. Wake not a sleeping wolf.#LBSFORGOLDI sent for you to come speak with me. There were charges against you that might have earned you the death penalty.I was advised that, since I was working for the army at the time, I shouldn’t go.The truth is, Sir John, that you are massively notorious.Anybody who wears a belt this big couldn’t be anything less than massive.Your bank account is thin, and yet you put it to huge waste.I wish it were the other way around: that my bank account were huge and my waist were thin.You’ve misled the young Prince.The young Prince has misled me. I’m the man with the big belly, and he’s the dog who walks in front of me.Well, I’d rather not open up a wound that’s just healed. The good work you did at Shrewsbury has made up a little for the bad thing you did at Gad’s Hill. You can thank the rebellion for helping you get away with that terrible deed.Really?But since things are calm now, let’s keep them that way. We won’t wake a sleeping wolf.
