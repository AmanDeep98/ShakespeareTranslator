What is this forest called?'Tis Gaultree Forest, an ’t shall please your Grace.Here stand, my lords, and send discoverers forthTo know the numbers of our enemies.We have sent forth already.   'Tis well done.My friends and brethren in these great affairs,I must acquaint you that I have receivedNew-dated letters from Northumberland,Their cold intent, tenor, and substance, thus:Here doth he wish his person, with such powersAs might hold sortance with his quality,The which he could not levy; whereuponHe is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,To Scotland, and concludes in hearty prayersThat your attempts may overlive the hazardAnd fearful melting of their opposite.Thus do the hopes we have in him touch groundAnd dash themselves to pieces.#LBSFORGOLDWhat’s the name of this forest?Gaultree Forest, your grace.Stop here, sirs. Send out scouts to find out how many soldiers our enemy has.We’ve already done that.Well done. My friends and brothers in this great undertaking, I have to share with you that I’ve received new letters from Northumberland. They have a chilling purpose, tone, and content. He says that he wishes he could be here in person, with an army as strong someone of his rank should have, but he couldn’t raise one. So he’s going to go to Scotland to increase his power. He prays that your armies will prevail against the terrible power of the enemy.And with that, any hope we had for him is thrown to the ground and dashed to pieces.
