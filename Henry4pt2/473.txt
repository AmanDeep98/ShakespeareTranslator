If he be sick with joy, he’ll recover without physic.Not so much noise, my lords.—Sweet Prince, speak low.The King your father is disposed to sleep.Let us withdraw into the other room.Will ’t please your Grace to go along with us?No, I will sit and watch here by the King.Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,Being so troublesome a bedfellow?O polished perturbation, golden care,That keep’st the ports of slumber open wideTo many a watchful night! sleep with it now;Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweetAs he whose brow with homely biggen boundSnores out the watch of night. O majesty,When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sitLike a rich armor worn in heat of day,That scald’st with safety. By his gates of breathThere lies a downy feather which stirs not;Did he suspire, that light and weightless downPerforce must move. My gracious lord, my father,This sleep is sound indeed. This is a sleepThat from this golden rigol hath divorcedSo many English kings. Thy due from meIs tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,Which nature, love, and filial tendernessShall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously.My due from thee is this imperial crown,Which, as immediate as thy place and blood,#LBSFORGOLDIf he’s sick from joy, then he’ll get better without medicine.Not so loud, sirs. Prince, speak more quietly. Your father the King is trying to sleep.Let’s go into the other room.Will you come with us?No. I’ll stay here with the King.Why does the crown lie there on his pillow, when it’s such a troublesome bedfellow? Oh polished aggravation, golden anxiety! You keep the eyelids open wide, to face countless sleepless nights. You sleep with the crown now, father, but you don’t sleep as soundly, or half so deeply, as that man whose head is bound with nothing more than a cheap nightcap, who snores through the night. Oh, you crown! When you pinch the person wearing you, you’re like a great suit of armor worn on a hot day—you burn the person you’re protecting. There’s a feather near my father’s lips, and it’s not moving: if he were breathing, that light, weightless thing would move. My gracious lord! Father! This is a deep sleep indeed—this is a sleep that has removed the golden ring from the heads of many English kings. Father, I owe you tears and a deep grief, and my love, the bonds of family, and a son’s tender feelings will make sure that I pay you lavishly. Your debt to me is this kingly crown, which I am owed as your heir-apparent.
