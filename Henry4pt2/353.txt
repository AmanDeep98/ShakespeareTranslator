I' faith, sweetheart, methinks now you are in an excellentgood temperality. Your pulsidge beats as extraordinarily asheart would desire, and your color, I warrant you, is as redas any rose, in good truth, la. But, i' faith, you have drunktoo much canaries, and that’s a marvellous searching wine,and it perfumes the blood ere one can say “What’s this?”How do you now?Better than I was. Hem.Why, that’s well said. A good heart’s worth gold.Lo, here comes Sir John.
(sings) When Arthur first in court—Empty the jordan.
(sings) And was a worthy king—How now, Mistress Doll?Sick of a calm, yea, good faith.So is all her sect. An they be once in a calm, they are sick.A pox damn you, muddy rascal. Is that all the comfort yougive me?You make fat rascals, Mistress Doll.#LBSFORGOLDI swear, sweetheart, you seem to be in a great temporalitytemporality = tempertemporality. Your pulsidgepulsidge = pulsepulsidge is beating as strongly as you could want, and your color is as red as a rose; truly! But seriously, I do think you’ve drank too much of that sweet wine from the Canary Islands—it’s a mighty powerful drink, and it’ll get into your blood faster than you can say, “What’s this?” How are you feeling now?Better than I was before. (she coughs or belches)
Well said! A healthy heart is worth its weight in gold. Look, here comes Sir John.
(singing)
“When Arthur first in court”—somebody empty the chamber pot! “And was a worthy king”The lyrics are from a popular ballad of the time, “Sir Lancelot du Lake.”“When Arthur first in court”—somebody empty the chamber pot! “And was a worthy king”—how are you, Mistress Doll?She’s sick of a qualmqualm = nausea, or a fainting spellqualm, she is.That’s how all the women in her profession are. As soon as they’re calm—and not in someone’s bed—they get sick.You stupid bastard. Is this how you make me feel better?You make fat bastards, Mistress Doll.
