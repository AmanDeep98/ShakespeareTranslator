Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick;But, ere they come, bid them o'erread these lettersAnd well consider of them. Make good speed.How many thousand of my poorest subjectsAre at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,Nature’s soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids downAnd steep my senses in forgetfulness?Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,Upon uneasy pallets stretching theeAnd hushed with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,Under the canopies of costly state,And lull’d with sound of sweetest melody?O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vileIn loathsome beds and leavest the kingly couchA watch-case or a common 'larum bell?Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mastSeal up the shipboy’s eyes, and rock his brainsIn cradle of the rude imperious surgeAnd in the visitation of the winds,Who take the ruffian billows by the top,Curling their monstrous heads and hanging themWith deafening clamor in the slippery cloudsThat with the hurly death itself awakes?Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy reposeTo the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,#LBSFORGOLDCall the earls of Surrey and Warwick. Tell them to read over these letters before they come, and to think carefully about them. Hurry.Thousands of even my poorest subjects are sleeping right now. Oh sleep! Oh sweet sleep, nature’s gentle healer, what have I done to frighten you? You won’t weigh down my eyelids anymore, or dull my mind to make me forget. Sleep, why do you lie in filthy hovels, stretched out on uncomfortable cots, where insects' buzzing is the lullaby? Why don’t you lie in the sweet-smelling bedrooms of kings, under opulent canopies, lulled with soft and beautiful music? You drowsy god, why do you lie with the common people in their loathsome beds, leaving the royal bed lonely like a sentry post, or a bell tower?Will you even close the eyes of a ship boy, high up on the whirling mast, and rock him gently in a cradle made of rough, tossing seas and howling winds—winds which take the waves and, curling them over, crashes them through the air with such a deafening noise that they wake death itself? Can you, oh unfair sleep, give rest to a drenched little sailor in the midst of such roughness, and yet deny it to a king?
