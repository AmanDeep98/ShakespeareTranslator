Thus have you heard our cause and known our means,And, my most noble friends, I pray you allSpeak plainly your opinions of our hopes.And first, Lord Marshal, what say you to it?I well allow the occasion of our arms,But gladly would be better satisfiedHow in our means we should advance ourselvesTo look with forehead bold and big enoughUpon the power and puissance of the King.Our present musters grow upon the fileTo five-and-twenty thousand men of choice,And our supplies live largely in the hopeOf great Northumberland, whose bosom burnsWith an incensèd fire of injuries.The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus:Whether our present five-and-twenty thousandMay hold up head without Northumberland.With him we may.   Yea, marry, there’s the point.But if without him we be thought too feeble,My judgment is we should not step too farTill we had his assistance by the hand.For in a theme so bloody-faced as this,Conjecture, expectation, and surmiseOf aids incertain should not be admitted.#LBSFORGOLDSo that’s what we’re fighting for, and that’s the kind of support we have. Now please, my noble friends, tell me frankly if you think we have a chance. First you, Marshal Mowbray. What do you say?I absolutely agree with our reasons for fighting. But given our resources, I’d feel better if I knew how we’re going to grow bold and strong enough to defeat this mighty and powerful King.Our army has grown to twenty-five thousand good men. Our reinforcements are coming with Northumberland, and his heart burns with anger over all he’s lost.Then, Lord Hastings, this is the question: can our twenty-five thousand get the job done without Northumberland?With him, we can.Yes, exactly, and that’s the point. If we’re too weak without him, then I don’t think we should advance until we know that his help is guaranteed. In a fight as bloody as this one, we need to be certain about the status of our supporters: we can’t rely on conjecture, hope, and guesswork when aid isn’t guaranteed.
