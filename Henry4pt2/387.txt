And, in the calmest and most stillest night,With all appliances and means to boot,Deny it to a king? Then, happy low, lie down.Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.Many good morrows to your Majesty.Is it good morrow, lords?'Tis one o'clock, and past.Why then, good morrow to you all, my lords.Have you read o'er the letter that I sent you?We have, my liege.Then you perceive the body of our kingdomHow foul it is, what rank diseases growAnd with what danger near the heart of it.It is but as a body yet distempered,Which to his former strength may be restoredWith good advice and little medicine.My Lord Northumberland will soon be cooled.O God, that one might read the book of fateAnd see the revolution of the timesMake mountains level, and the continent,Weary of solid firmness, melt itselfInto the sea, and other times to seeThe beachy girdle of the oceanToo wide for Neptune’s hips; how chance’s mocksAnd changes fill the cup of alteration#LBSFORGOLDA king on the calmest, stillest night, with everything available for sleep? Then, you happy commoners, put yourselves to bed. The head that wears the crown sleeps uneasily.Good morning, your highness.Is it morning, lords?It’s after one o'clock.Well, then, good morning to you all, my lords. Have you read the letters I sent you?We have, your highness.Then you can tell how sick the kingdom is. There are serious diseases spreading through its body, very near its heart.The body’s only out of sorts. It can be brought back to full health through good care and some medicine. Northumberland will soon be suppressed.Oh God! If only we could read the book of destiny! We’d see how time changes everything, bringing mountains low and melting the land—which is tired of being solid and firm—into the sea. We’d see how the beach is sometimes too wide for even the tide to conquer. We’d see how blind luck can make mockeries of men, and how change can affect you in countless ways.
