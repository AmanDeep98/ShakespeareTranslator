I pledge your Grace, and if you knew what painsI have bestowed to breed this present peace,You would drink freely. But my love to youShall show itself more openly hereafter.I do not doubt you.   I am glad of it.—Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.You wish me health in very happy season,For I am on the sudden something ill.Against ill chances men are ever merry,But heaviness foreruns the good event.Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrowServes to say thus: “Some good thing comes tomorrow.”Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.So much the worse if your own rule be true.The word of peace is rendered. Hark how they shout.This had been cheerful after victory.A peace is of the nature of a conquest,For then both parties nobly are subdued,And neither party loser.#LBSFORGOLDI drink to your grace. If you knew how hard I’ve worked to bring about this peaceful resolution, you’d really drink up. But my love for you will be more apparent from now on.I don’t doubt it.I’m glad. And here’s to your health, my gentle cousin Lord Mowbray.You wish me good health at a very good moment, because for some reason I’m suddenly feeling ill.Men are always merry in the face of bad situations, but a heavy heart predicts a happy event.So be happy, kinsman. A sudden feeling of melancholy is just a sign that says, “Something good is coming tomorrow.”Believe me, I’m in really good spirits.Which is not a good thing, if your own rule is correct.The news of peace has been announced. Listen to them shout!They sound like they are cheering a victory.Peace is a victory of sorts: both sides stop fighting honorably, but neither loses.
