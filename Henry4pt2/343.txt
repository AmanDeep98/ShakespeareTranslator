This Doll Tearsheet should be some road.I warrant you, as common as the way between Saint Alban’sand London.How might we see Falstaff bestow himself tonight in his truecolors, and not ourselves be seen?Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and wait upon himat his table as drawers.From a god to a bull: a heavy decension. It was Jove’s case.From a prince to a 'prentice: a low transformation that shallbe mine, for in everything the purpose must weigh with thefolly. Follow me, Ned.#LBSFORGOLDThis Doll Tearsheet must be some roadroad = slang for “common prostitute”road.Truly, she’s as well-traveled as the highway to London.How can we see Falstaff behave like his true self tonight, and yet not be detected ourselves?We’ll put on leather jackets and aprons and wait upon him as bartenders.Should a God disguise himself as a bull? That’s quite a degradation. Well, JoveThe Roman god Jove disguised himself as a white bull to carry away the maiden EuropaJove did it. And should a prince disguise himself as an apprentice bartender and transform into something so lowly? Yes, I will: in every undertaking, the ends must match the means. Follow me, Ned.
