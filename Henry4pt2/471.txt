This apoplexy will certain be his end.I pray you, take me up and bear me henceInto some other chamber. Softly, pray.Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends,Unless some dull and favorable handWill whisper music to my weary spirit.Call for the music in the other room.Set me the crown upon my pillow here.His eye is hollow, and he changes much.Less noise, less noise.   Who saw the Duke of Clarence?I am here, brother, full of heaviness.How now! Rain within doors, and none abroad?How doth the King?   Exceeding ill.Heard he the good news yet? Tell it him.He altered much upon the hearing it.#LBSFORGOLDThese attacks will be the death of him.Please, carry me into another room. Quietly. Please.Please be silent, my friends, unless someone can play some restful, whispering music for my exhausted spirit.Call the musicians in from the other room.Put the crown here on my pillow.His eyes are sunken, and he seems very pale.Less noise, less noise!Has anybody seen the Duke of Clarence?I’m here, brother, full of sadness.What’s going on? Raining inside while it’s dry outside? How’s the King?Extremely sick.Has he heard the good news yet? Tell him.Yes, he heard it, and it affected him deeply.
