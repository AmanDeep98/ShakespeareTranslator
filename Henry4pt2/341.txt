What pagan may that be?A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of mymaster’s.Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town bull.—Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?I am your shadow, my lord. I’ll follow you.Sirrah—you, boy—and Bardolph, no word to your masterthat I am yet come to town. (gives them money) There’s foryour silence.I have no tongue, sir.And for mine, sir, I will govern it.Fare you well. Go.#LBSFORGOLDWhat heathen is that?A proper lady, sir, and my master’s relative.Exactly the kind of relative as the country cows are to the town bull. Ned, should we spy on them as they eat supper?I’m after you like a shadow, my lord: I’ll follow you.Sirrah, you boy, and you, Bardolph—don’t tell your master that I’m back in town. (gives them money) This is for your silence.I have no tongue to speak with, sir.As for my tongue, I’ll manage it.Farewell to you both; go now.
