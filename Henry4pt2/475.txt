Derives itself to me. (he puts the crown on his head) Lo,   where it sits,Which God shall guard. And put the world’s whole strengthInto one giant arm, it shall not forceThis lineal honor from me. This from theeWill I to mine leave, as ’tis left to me.
(waking) Warwick! Gloucester! Clarence!   Doth the King call?What would your Majesty? How fares your Grace?Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?We left the Prince my brother here, my liege,Who undertook to sit and watch by you.The Prince of Wales? Where is he? Let me see him.He is not here.This door is open. He is gone this way.He came not through the chamber where we stayed.Where is the crown? Who took it from my pillow?When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.The Prince hath ta'en it hence. Go seek him out.Is he so hasty that he doth suppose my sleep my death?Find him, my Lord of Warwick. Chide him hither.#LBSFORGOLD
(he puts the crown on his head) Look, here it sits, and God will guard it. Even if all the strength in the world were gathered into a single, giant arm, it wouldn’t be able to force this inherited honor from me. I will leave this to my son as you’ve left it to me.
(waking) Warwick! Gloucester! Clarence!Did you call, sir?What can we do for you, your highness? How are you feeling?Why did you leave me alone, sirs?We left my brother, Prince Hal, here. He decided to sit with you.The Prince of Wales? Where is he? I want to see him. He’s not here.This door’s open. He went this way.He didn’t come through the room we were in.Where’s the crown? Who took it off my pillow?When we left, sir, it was here.The Prince has taken it. Go, find him. Is he in such a hurry that he thinks my sleep is my death? Find him, Lord Warwick. Rebuke him, and bring him here.
