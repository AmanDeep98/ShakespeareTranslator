He is addressed. Press near and second him.Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.Are we all ready? What is now amissThat Caesar and his senate must redress?
(kneeling)
Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,Metellus Cimber throws before thy seatAn humble heart—    I must prevent
                                thee, Cimber.These couchings and these lowly courtesiesMight fire the blood of ordinary menAnd turn preordinance and first decreeInto the law of children. Be not fond,To think that Caesar bears such rebel bloodThat will be thawed from the true qualityWith that which melteth fools—I mean, sweet words,Low-crookèd curtsies, and base spaniel fawning.Thy brother by decree is banishèd.If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without causeWill he be satisfied.Is there no voice more worthy than my ownTo sound more sweetly in great Caesar’s earFor the repealing of my banished brother?
(kneeling) I kiss thy hand, but not
                                in flattery, Caesar,Desiring thee that Publius Cimber mayHave an immediate freedom of repeal.#LBSFORGOLDThey’re speaking to him. Go up there and second his
                                petition.Casca, you’ll be the first to raise your hand.Are we all ready? What problem should I discuss with you
                            first?
(kneeling) Most high, most mighty,
                                and most powerful Caesar, Metellus Cimber kneels before you with a
                                humble heart—I have to stop you, Cimber. These kneelings and humble courtesies
                                might excite ordinary men, flattering them into turning Roman law
                                into children’s games. But don’t be so foolish as
                                to think you can sway me from
                                what’s right by using the tactics that persuade
                                fools—I mean this flattery, low bows, and puppy-like
                                fawning. Your brother has been banished by decree. If you kneel and
                                beg and flatter for him, I’ll kick you out of my way like I
                                would a dog. Know that I am not unjust, and I will not grant him a
                                pardon without reason.Is there no voice worthier than my own to appeal to Caesar to
                                repeal the order that my brother be banished?
(kneeling) I kiss your hand, but
                                not in flattery, Caesar. I ask you to repeal Publius
                                Cimber’s banishment immediately.
