If Brutus will vouchsafe that AntonyMay safely come to him and be resolvedHow Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,Mark Antony shall not love Caesar deadSo well as Brutus living, but will followThe fortunes and affairs of noble BrutusThorough the hazards of this untrod stateWith all true faith. So says my master Antony.Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman.I never thought him worse.Tell him, so please him come unto this place,He shall be satisfied and, by my honor,Depart untouched.

                                fetch him presently.I know that we shall have him well to friend.I wish we may. But yet have I a mindThat fears him much, and my misgiving stillFalls shrewdly to the purpose.But here comes Antony.—Welcome, Mark Antony.O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.—I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,Who else must be let blood, who else is rank.#LBSFORGOLDIf Brutus will swear that Antony may come to him safely and be
                                convinced that Caesar deserved to be killed, Mark Antony will love
                                dead Caesar not nearly as much as living Brutus, and with true faith
                                he’ll follow the destiny and affairs of noble Brutus
                                through the difficulties of this unprecedented state of
                                affairs.” That’s what my master, Antony,
                            says.Your master is a wise and honorable Roman. I never thought any
                                less of him. Tell him, if he comes here, I’ll explain
                                everything to him and, on my word, he’ll leave
                            unharmed.
(getting up) I’ll get him
                                now.I know that he’ll be on our side.I hope we can count on him, but I still fear him, and my hunches
                                are usually accurate.But here comes Antony.—Welcome, Mark Antony.Oh, mighty Caesar! Do you lie so low? Have all your conquests,
                                glories, triumphs, achievements, come to so little? Farewell.
                                Gentlemen, I don’t know what you intend to do, who else you
                                intend to kill, who else you consider corrupt.
