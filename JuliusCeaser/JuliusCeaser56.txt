For if thou path, thy native semblance on,Not Erebus itself were dim enoughTo hide thee from prevention.I think we are too bold upon your rest.Good morrow, Brutus. Do we trouble you?I have been up this hour, awake all night.Know I these men that come along with you?Yes, every man of them, and no man hereBut honors you, and every one doth wishYou had but that opinion of yourselfWhich every noble Roman bears of you.This is Trebonius.    He is welcome
                                hither.This, Decius Brutus.He is welcome too.This, Casca. This, Cinna. And this, Metellus Cimber.They are all welcome.What watchful cares do interpose themselvesBetwixt your eyes and night?Shall I entreat a word?#LBSFORGOLDIf you went ahead and exposed your true face, Hell itself
                                wouldn’t be dark enough to keep you from being found and

                                high an opinion of yourself as every noble Roman has of you. This is
                                Trebonius.He’s welcome here.This is Decius Brutus.He’s welcome too.This is Casca. This is Cinna. And this is Metellus Cimber.They’re all welcome. What worries have kept you awake
