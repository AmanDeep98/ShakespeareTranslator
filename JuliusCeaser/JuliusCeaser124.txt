Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced.Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,No Rome of safety for Octavius yet.Hie hence, and tell him so.—Yet, stay awhile.Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corseInto the marketplace. There shall I try,In my oration, how the people takeThe cruèl issue of these bloody men.According to the which, thou shalt discourseTo young Octavius of the state of things.Lend me your hand.#LBSFORGOLDReport back to him fast and tell him what has happened. This is
                                now a Rome in mourning, a dangerous Rome. It’s not safe
                                enough for Octavius yet. Hurry away and tell him so. No, wait, stay
                                a minute. Don’t go back until I’ve carried the
                                corpse into the marketplace. There I’ll use my speech to
                                test what the people think of these bloody men’s cruel
                                action. You’ll report back to young Octavius how they
                                respond. Help me here.
