I am not well in health, and that is all.Brutus is wise, and were he not in health,He would embrace the means to come by it.Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.Is Brutus sick? And is it physicalTo walk unbracèd and suck up the humorsOf the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,To dare the vile contagion of the nightAnd tempt the rheumy and unpurgèd airTo add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus.You have some sick offense within your mind,Which by the right and virtue of my placeI ought to know of.
(kneels) And upon my kneesI charm you, by my once-commended beauty,By all your vows of love and that great vowWhich did incorporate and make us oneThat you unfold to me, your self, your half,Why you are heavy, and what men tonightHave had to resort to you. For here have beenSome six or seven who did hide their facesEven from darkness.    Kneel not,
                                gentle Portia.
(rising) I should not need if you
                                were gentle, Brutus.Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,Is it excepted I should know no secretsThat appertain to you? Am I yourselfBut, as it were, in sort or limitation,To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,And talk to you sometimes?#LBSFORGOLDI’m not feeling well—that’s
                            all.You’re smart, though, and if you were sick,
                                you’d take what you needed to get better.I’m doing so. Good Portia, go to bed.Are you sick? And is it healthy to walk uncovered and breathe in
                                the dampness of the morning? You’re sick, yet you sneak out
                                of your warm bed and let the humid and disease-infested air make you
                                sicker? No, my Brutus, you have some sickness within your mind,
                                which by virtue of my position I deserve to know about.
                                (she kneels) And on my knees, I urge
                                you, by my once-praised beauty, by all your vows of love and that
                                great vow of marriage which made the two of us one person, that you
                                should reveal to me, who is one half of yourself, why
                                you’re troubled and what men have visited you tonight. For
                                there were six or seven men here, who hid their faces even in the
                                darkness.Don’t kneel, noble Portia.
(getting up) I wouldn’t
                                need to if you were acting nobly. Tell me, Brutus, as your wife,
                                aren’t I supposed to be told the secrets that concern you?
                                Am I part of you only in a limited sense—I get to have
                                dinner with you, sleep with you, and talk to you sometimes?
