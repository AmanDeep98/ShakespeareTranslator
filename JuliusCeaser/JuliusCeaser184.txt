Therein our letters do not well agree.Mine speak of seventy senators that diedBy their proscriptions, Cicero being one.Cicero one?   Cicero is dead,And by that order of proscription.
(to
                                BRUTUS) Had you your letters from
                                your wife, my lord?No, Messala.Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?Nothing, Messala.   That methinks is
                            strange.Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?No, my lord.Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell.For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.With meditating that she must die once,I have the patience to endure it now.Even so great men great losses should endure.#LBSFORGOLDOn that point, our letters don’t agree. My letters say
                                only seventy senators were killed, one being Cicero.Cicero too?Cicero is dead, by their decree.
                                (to
                                BRUTUS) Have you received letters
                                from your wife, my lord?No, Messala.And you haven’t heard any news about her in your
                            letters?Nothing, Messala.I think that’s strange.Why do you ask? Have you heard something of her in your
                            letters?No, my lord.Now, as you’re a Roman, tell me the truth.Then you must take the truth I have to tell like a Roman.
                                It’s certain that she is dead, and she died in a strange
                                way.Well, good-bye, Portia. We all must die, Messala. Having already
                                thought about the fact that she would have to die sometime, I can
                                endure her death now.That’s the way great men ought to endure great
                            losses.
