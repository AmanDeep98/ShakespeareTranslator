'Tis just.And it is very much lamented, Brutus,That you have no such mirrors as will turnYour hidden worthiness into your eyeThat you might see your shadow. I have heardWhere many of the best respect in Rome,Except immortal Caesar, speaking of BrutusAnd groaning underneath this age’s yoke,Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes.Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,That you would have me seek into myselfFor that which is not in me?Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear.And since you know you cannot see yourselfSo well as by reflection, I, your glass,Will modestly discover to yourselfThat of yourself which you yet know not of.And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus.Were I a common laugher, or did useTo stale with ordinary oaths my loveTo every new protester, if you knowThat I do fawn on men and hug them hardAnd, after, scandal them, or if you knowThat I profess myself in banquetingTo all the rout, then hold me dangerous.What means this shouting? I do fear, the peopleChoose Caesar for their king.     Ay,
                                do you fear it?Then must I think you would not have it so.#LBSFORGOLDThat’s true. And it’s too bad, Brutus, that you
                                don’t have any mirrors that could display your hidden
                                excellence to yourself. I’ve heard many of the noblest
                                Romans—next to immortal Caesar—speaking of
                                you, complaining of the tyranny of today’s government, and
                                wishing that your eyes were working better.What dangers are you trying to lead me into, Cassius, that you
                                want me to look inside myself for something that’s not
                                there?I’ll tell you, good Brutus. And since you know you can
                                see yourself best by reflection, I’ll be your mirror and
                                show you, without exaggeration, things inside you that you
                                can’t see. And don’t be suspicious of me, noble
                                Brutus. If I were your average fool, or if I made my feelings for
                                you worthless by making the same promises of friendship to
                                everybody, or if you’d seen me first flattering men,
                                hugging them tightly, and later slandering them behind their backs,
                                or if you hear that I drunkenly declare friendship at banquets with
                                all the rabble, only then, of course, go ahead and assume
                                I’m dangerous.Why are they shouting? I’m afraid the people have made
                                Caesar their king.Really, are you afraid of that? Then I have to assume you
                                don’t want him to be king.
