These many, then, shall die. Their names are pricked.
(to
                                LEPIDUS)
Your brother too must die. Consent you, Lepidus?I do consent—   Prick him down,
                            Antony.Upon condition Publius shall not live,Who is your sister’s son, Mark Antony.He shall not live. Look, with a spot I damn him.But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar’s house.Fetch the will hither, and we shall determineHow to cut off some charge in legacies.What, shall I find you here?Or here, or at the Capitol.This is a slight, unmeritable man,Meet to be sent on errands. Is it fit,The threefold world divided, he should standOne of the three to share it?#LBSFORGOLDThese ones, then, will be assassinated. Their names are
                            marked.
(to
                                LEPIDUS) Your brother has to die too.
                                Do you agree, Lepidus?I agree—Put a mark next to his name too, Antony.On the condition that your sister’s son, Publius, also
                                must die, Mark Antony.He will die. See—I’ve sealed his fate with
                                this mark next to his name. But, Lepidus, go to Caesar’s
                                house. Bring his will here, and we’ll figure out a way to
                                reduce his bequests to the people.Will you be here when I return?Either here or at the Capitol.He’s an unremarkable man, fit only to be sent on errands.
                                Does it really make sense, once we divide the world into three
                                parts, that he should be one of the three rulers?
