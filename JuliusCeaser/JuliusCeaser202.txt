I do not cross you. But I will do so.They stand and would have parley.Stand fast, Titinius. We must out and talk.Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.Make forth. The generals would have some words.
(to his army) Stir not until the
                                signal.Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?Not that we love words better, as you do.Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.Witness the hole you made in Caesar’s heart,Crying “Long live, hail, Caesar!”     Antony,The posture of your blows are yet unknown.But for your words, they rob the Hybla beesAnd leave them honeyless.#LBSFORGOLDI’m not defying you, but it’s what I’m
                                going to do.They’ve stopped. They want to talk.Stay here, Titinius. We have to go out and talk to them.Mark Antony, should we give the signal to attack?No, Octavius Caesar, we’ll respond to their charge. Go
                                forward. The generals want to speak with us.
(to his army) Don’t move
                                until we give the signal.Words before fighting. Is that how it is, countrymen?Not that we love words more than fighting, like you do.Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.Brutus, you give a nice speech along with your evil strokes. Think
                                of the hole you made in Caesar’s heart when you cried,
                                “Long live Caesar! Hail Caesar!”Antony, we don’t yet know what kind of blows you can
                                inflict. But your words are as sweet as
                                honey—you’ve stolen from the bees and left them
                                with nothing.
