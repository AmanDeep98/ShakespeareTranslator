Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.Thrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out,“Help, ho! They murder
                                Caesar!”—Who’s within?My lord.Go bid the priests do present sacrificeAnd bring me their opinions of success.I will, my lord.What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?You shall not stir out of your house today.Caesar shall forth. The things that threatened meNe'er looked but on my back. When they shall seeThe face of Caesar, they are vanishèd.Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,Yet now they fright me. There is one within,Besides the things that we have heard and seen,Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.A lioness hath whelpèd in the streets,And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead.#LBSFORGOLDNeither the sky nor the earth have been quiet tonight. Calphurnia
                                cried out three times in her sleep, “Help, someone!
                                They’re murdering Caesar!” Who’s
                                there?My lord?Go tell the priests to perform a sacrifice immediately, and bring
                                me their interpretation of the results.I will, my lord.What are you doing, Caesar? Are you planning to go out?
                                You’re not leaving the house today.I will go out. The things that threaten me have only seen my back.
                                When they see the face of Caesar, they will vanish.Caesar, I never believed in omens, but now they frighten me. A
                                servant told me the night-watchmen saw horrid sights too, but
                                different ones from what we heard and saw. A lioness gave birth in
                                the streets, and graves cracked open and thrust out their
                            dead.
