And yesterday the bird of night did sitEven at noon-day upon the marketplace,Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigiesDo so conjointly meet, let not men say,“These are their reasons. They are
                                natural.”For I believe they are portentous thingsUnto the climate that they point upon.Indeed, it is a strange-disposèd time.But men may construe things after their fashion,Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?He doth, for he did bid AntoniusSend word to you he would be there tomorrow.Good night then, Casca. This disturbèd skyIs not to walk in.Farewell, Cicero.Who’s there?   A Roman.    Casca, by your
                                voice.Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!A very pleasing night to honest men.Who ever knew the heavens menace so?#LBSFORGOLDAnd yesterday the night owl sat hooting and shrieking in the
                                marketplace at noon. When all these extraordinary things happen at
                                once, we shouldn’t say, “These happenings can
                                be explained rationally. They’re natural
                                enough.” I think these things are omens of things to
                                come in our country.Indeed, it’s a strange time. But men tend to interpret
                                things however suits them and totally miss the actual meaning of the
                                things themselves. Is Caesar visiting the Capitol tomorrow?He is, because he told Antonius to tell you he’d be there
                                tomorrow.Good night then, Casca. This bad weather isn’t good to
                                walk around in.Farewell, CiceroWho’s there?A Roman.It’s Casca—I know your voice.Your ear is good. Cassius, what a night this is!It’s a very pleasing night to honest men.Who ever saw the heavens threaten like this?
