Even by the rule of that philosophyBy which I did blame Cato for the deathWhich he did give himself (I know not how,But I do find it cowardly and vile,For fear of what might fall, so to preventThe time of life), arming myself with patienceTo stay the providence of some high powersThat govern us below.    Then if we
                                lose this battleYou are contented to be led in triumphThorough the streets of Rome?No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome.He bears too great a mind. But this same dayMust end that work the ides of March begun.And whether we shall meet again I know not.Therefore our everlasting farewell take.Forever and forever farewell, Cassius.If we do meet again, why, we shall smile.If not, why then this parting was well made.Forever and forever farewell, Brutus.If we do meet again, we’ll smile indeed.If not, ’tis true this parting was well made.Why then, lead on. Oh, that a man might knowThe end of this day’s business ere it come!But it sufficeth that the day will end,And then the end is known.—Come, ho! Away!#LBSFORGOLDBy the same principle that made me condemn Cato for committing
                                suicide, I plan to be patient and submit to what the gods decide. I
                                don’t know why, but I find it cowardly and vile to kill
                                oneself early to prevent possible suffering later on.Then if we lose this battle, you’ll be willing to be led
                                in chains through the streets of Rome?No, Cassius, no. Don’t imagine that I’ll ever
                                allow myself to return to Rome in chains. My mind is too great for
                                that. But today, the work that March 15th began must end, and I
                                don’t know if we’ll meet again. Therefore, accept
                                my everlasting farewell. Forever and forever, farewell, Cassius! If
                                we meet again, then we’ll smile. If not, then this parting
                                was well done.Forever and forever, farewell, Brutus! If we meet again, then
                                we’ll smile indeed. If not, it’s true, this
                                parting was well done.Well, lead on. Oh, I wish I could know what will happen today
                                before it happens! But it’s enough to know that the day
                                will end, and then the end will be known. Come! Let’s
                            go!
