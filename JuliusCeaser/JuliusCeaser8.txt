Calphurnia!Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.Calphurnia!Here, my lord.Stand you directly in Antonius' wayWhen he doth run his course.—Antonius!Caesar, my lord.Forget not in your speed, Antonius,To touch Calphurnia, for our elders sayThe barren, touchèd in this holy chase,Shake off their sterile curse.    I shall
                                remember.When Caesar says, “do this,” it is
                                performed.Set on, and leave no ceremony out.Caesar!#LBSFORGOLDCalphurnia!Quiet! Caesar’s talking.Calphurnia!I’m here, my lord.Stand right in Antonius’s path when he runs the race.
                                Antonius!Yes, Caesar?Antonius, after you take off, don’t forget to touch
                                Calphurnia, because our wise elders say that if you touch an
                                infertile woman during this holy race, she’ll be freed from
                                the curse of sterility.I’ll remember. When Caesar says “do
                                this,” it is done.Continue, then, and don’t forget to perform all of the
