    Hath Cassius
                                livedTo be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,When grief and blood ill-tempered vexeth him?When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too.Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.And my heart too.    O
                            Brutus!     What’s
                                the matter?Have not you love enough to bear with me,When that rash humor which my mother gave meMakes me forgetful?    Yes, Cassius.
                                And from henceforthWhen you are over-earnest with your Brutus,He’ll think your mother chides and leave you so.
(within) Let me go in to see the
                                generals.There is some grudge between 'em. 'Tis not meetThey be alone.

                            them.
(within) Nothing but death shall
                                stay me.#LBSFORGOLDHave I lived this long only to be the butt of a joke whenever
                                you’re angry or frustrated?When I said that, I was angry too.You admit it, then? Give me your hand.And my heart too.Oh, Brutus!What’s the matter?Do you have enough love for me to be patient when my bad temper,
                                which I inherited from my mother, makes me forget how I should
                                behave?Yes, Cassius. And from now on, when you get hot with me,
                                I’ll assume it’s your mother speaking and leave it
                                at that.
(offstage) Let me in to see the
                                generals. There’s a grudge between them, and it
                                isn’t a good idea for them to be alone.
(offstage) You can’t see
                                them.
(offstage) You’d have to
                                kill me to stop me.
