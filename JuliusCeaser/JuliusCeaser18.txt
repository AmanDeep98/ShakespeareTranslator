Is now become a god, and Cassius isA wretched creature and must bend his bodyIf Caesar carelessly but nod on him.He had a fever when he was in Spain,And when the fit was on him, I did markHow he did shake. 'Tis true, this god did shake!His coward lips did from their color fly,And that same eye whose bend doth awe the worldDid lose his luster. I did hear him groan,Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the RomansMark him and write his speeches in their books—“Alas,” it cried, “give me
                                some drink, Titinius,”As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze meA man of such a feeble temper shouldSo get the start of the majestic worldAnd bear the palm alone.    Another

                                “Caesar”?Why should that name be sounded more than yours?Write them together, yours is as fair a name.Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well.Weigh them, it is as heavy. Conjure with 'em,#LBSFORGOLDAnd this is the man who has now become a god, and I’m a
                                wretched creature who must bow down if Caesar so much as carelessly
                                nods my way. In Spain, Caesar had a fever, and it made him shake.
                                It’s true, this so-called
                                “god”—he shook. His cowardly
                                lips turned white, and the same eye whose gaze terrifies the world
                                lost its gleam. I heard him groan—yes, I
                                did—and the same tongue that ordered the Romans to obey
                                him and transcribe his speeches in their books cried,
                                “Give me some water, Titinius,” like a sick
                                girl. It astounds me that such a weak man could beat the whole world
                                and carry the trophy of victory alone.More shouting! I think this applause is for some new honors
                                awarded to Caesar.Why, Caesar straddles the narrow world like a giant, and we petty
                                men walk under his huge legs and look forward only to dying
                                dishonorably, as slaves. Men can be masters of their fate. It is not
                                destiny’s fault, but our own faults, that we’re
                                slaves. “Brutus” and
                                “Caesar.” What’s so special about
                                “Caesar”? Why should that name be proclaimed
                                more than yours? Write them together—yours is just as
                                good a name. Pronounce them—it is just as nice to say.
                                Weigh them—it’s just as heavy.
