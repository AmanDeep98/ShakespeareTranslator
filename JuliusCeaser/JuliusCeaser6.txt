And do you now strew flowers in his wayThat comes in triumph over Pompey’s blood?Be gone!Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,Pray to the gods to intermit the plagueThat needs must light on this ingratitude.Go, go, good countrymen, and for this fault,Assemble all the poor men of your sort,Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tearsInto the channel till the lowest streamDo kiss the most exalted shores of all.See whether their basest metal be not moved.They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.Go you down that way towards the Capitol.This way will I. Disrobe the imagesIf you do find them decked with ceremonies.May we do so?You know it is the feast of Lupercal.It is no matter. Let no imagesBe hung with Caesar’s trophies. I’ll aboutAnd drive away the vulgar from the streets.So do you too, where you perceive them thick.These growing feathers plucked from Caesar’s wingWill make him fly an ordinary pitch,Who else would soar above the view of menAnd keep us all in servile fearfulness.#LBSFORGOLDAnd now you toss flowers in the path of Caesar, who comes in
                                triumph over Pompey’s defeated sons? Go home! Run to your
                                houses, fall on your knees, and pray to the gods to spare you the
                                pain that you deserve for such ingratitude.Go, go, good countrymen, and to make up for having done wrong,
                                gather up all the poor men like yourselves, lead them to the Tiber,
                                and weep into the river until it overflows its banks.Well, that ought to move even the most thickheaded of them. There
                                they go, feeling so guilty they’re now
                                tongue-tied—they don’t have a thing to say. You
                                go down toward the Capitol, and I’ll go this way. Undress
                                the statues if they’re decorated in honor of Caesar.Can we do that? You know it’s the feast of LupercalThe feast of Lupercal is an annual celebration to honor the Roman god Lupercus (called Pan in Greek mythology).Lupercal.It doesn’t matter. Make sure that none of the statues are
                                decorated in tribute to Caesar. I’ll walk around and force
                                the commoners off the streets. You do the same, wherever the crowds
                                are thick. If we take away Caesar’s support, he’ll
                                have to come back down to earth; otherwise, he’ll fly too
                                high and keep the rest of us in a state of fear and
                            obedience.
