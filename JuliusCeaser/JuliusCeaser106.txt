Ambition’s debt is paid.Go to the pulpit, Brutus.And Cassius too.Where’s Publius?Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar’sShould chance—Talk not of standing.—Publius, good cheer.There is no harm intended to your person,Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius.#LBSFORGOLDAnd you too, Brutus? In that case, die, Caesar.
(he dies)
Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead! Run and proclaim it in the
                                streets.Some should go to the public platforms and cry out,
                                “Liberty, freedom, and democracy!”People and senators, don’t be afraid. Don’t run
                                away—stay where you are. Only Caesar had to die for his
                                ambition.Go to the platform, Brutus.And Cassius too.Where’s Publius?Here. He’s completely stunned by this mutiny.Stand close together, in case someone loyal to Caesar tries
                                to—Don’t talk about standing together.—Publius,
                                cheer up. We don’t intend any harm to you, nor to anyone
                                else. Tell them this, Publius.
