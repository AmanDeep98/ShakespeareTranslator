I will be here again, even with a thought.Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill.My sight was ever thick. Regard Titinius,And tell me what thou notest about the field.This day I breathed first. Time is come round,And where I did begin, there shall I end.My life is run his compass.
(to
                                PINDARUS)    Sirrah,
                                what news?
(above) O my lord!What news?
(above) Titinius is
                                enclosèd round aboutWith horsemen, that make to him on the spur.Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.Now, Titinius. Now some light. Oh, he lights too.He’s ta'en.And, hark! They shout for joy.    Come down,
                                behold no more.Oh, coward that I am, to live so longTo see my best friend ta'en before my face!#LBSFORGOLDI’ll be back quicker than you can think a thought.Go, Pindarus, climb a little higher on this hill. My eyesight has
                                always been bad. Watch Titinius and tell me what you see in the
                                field.Today was the day I breathed my first breath. Time has come round,
                                and I’ll end where I began. My life has run its circle.
                                (to
                                PINDARUS) What can you see,
                            boy?
(above) Oh, my lord!What news?
(above) Titinius is surrounded by
                                horsemen who are quickly approaching him, yet he spurs onward. Now
                                they’re almost on him. Now, Titinius! Now some dismount.
                                Oh, he gets down too. He’s taken.And listen! They shout for joy.Come down, look no more. Oh, I’m such a coward for living
                                long enough to see my best friend taken before my eyes!
