Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.By the eighth hour. Is that the uttermost?Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.I wonder none of you have thought of him.Now, good Metellus, go along by him.He loves me well, and I have given him reasons.Send him but hither and I’ll fashion him.The morning comes upon ’s. We’ll leave you,
                                Brutus.—And, friends, disperse yourselves. But all rememberWhat you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily.Let not our looks put on our purposes,But bear it as our Roman actors do,With untired spirits and formal constancy.And so good morrow to you every one.#LBSFORGOLDNo, we’ll all go there to bring him.By eight o'clock. Is that the latest we can do it?Let’s make that the latest, but be sure to get there
                                before then.Caius Ligarius doesn’t like Caesar, who berated him for
                                speaking well of Pompey. I wonder that none of you thought about
                                getting his support.Good Metellus, go to him now. He likes me, and I’ve given
                                him good reason to. Just send him here, and I’ll persuade
                                him.The morning is approaching. We’ll leave, Brutus. Friends,
                                go your separate ways. But all of you, remember what you’ve
                                said and prove yourselves true Romans.Good gentlemen, look like you’re rested and happy.
                                Don’t let our faces betray our plans. Instead, carry
                                yourselves like Roman actors, with cheerful spirits and
                                well-composed faces. And so, good morning to all of you.
