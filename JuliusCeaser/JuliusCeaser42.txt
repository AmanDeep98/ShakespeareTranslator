And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?Poor man! I know he would not be a wolfBut that he sees the Romans are but sheep.He were no lion were not Romans hinds.Those that with haste will make a mighty fireBegin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,What rubbish and what offal, when it servesFor the base matter to illuminateSo vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak thisBefore a willing bondman. Then I knowMy answer must be made. But I am armed,And dangers are to me indifferent.You speak to Casca, and to such a manThat is no fleering telltale. Hold, my hand.Be factious for redress of all these griefs,And I will set this foot of mine as farAs who goes farthest.    There’s
                                a bargain made.Now know you, Casca, I have moved alreadySome certain of the noblest-minded RomansTo undergo with me an enterpriseOf honorable-dangerous consequence.And I do know by this they stay for meIn Pompey’s porch. For now, this fearful night,There is no stir or walking in the streets,And the complexion of the elementIn favor’s like the work we have in hand,Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.#LBSFORGOLDHow can Caesar be a tyrant then? Poor man! I know he
                                wouldn’t be a wolf if the Romans didn’t act like
                                sheep. He couldn’t be a lion if the Romans weren’t
                                such easy prey. People who want to start a big fire quickly start
                                with little twigs. Rome becomes complete trash, nothing but rubbish
                                and garbage, when it works to light up the ambitions of someone as
                                worthless as Caesar. But, oh no! What have I said in my grief? I
                                might be speaking to someone who
                                wants to be a slave, in which case
                                I’ll be held accountable for my words. But I’m
                                armed and I don’t care about danger.You’re talking to Casca, not to some smiling, two-faced
                                tattletale. Say no more. Shake my hand. If you’re joining
                                together to right these wrongs, I’ll go as far as any one
                                of you.That’s a deal. Now let me tell you, Casca, I have already
                                convinced some of the noblest Romans to join me in an honorable but
                                dangerous mission. And I know that by now they’re waiting
                                for me on the porch outside Pompey’s theater.
                                We’re meeting on this fearful night because no one is out
                                on the streets. The sky tonight looks bloody, fiery, and terrible,
                                just like the work we have to do.
