Now, Antony, our hopes are answerèd.You said the enemy would not come downBut keep the hills and upper regions.It proves not so. Their battles are at hand.They mean to warn us at Philippi here,Answering before we do demand of them.Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I knowWherefore they do it. They could be contentTo visit other places, and come downWith fearful bravery, thinking by this faceTo fasten in our thoughts that they have courage.But ’tis not so.   Prepare you, generals.The enemy comes on in gallant show.Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,And something to be done immediately.Octavius, lead your battle softly on,Upon the left hand of the even field.Upon the right hand I. Keep thou the left.Why do you cross me in this exigent?#LBSFORGOLDNow, Antony, our prayers have been answered. You said the enemy
                                wouldn’t come down but keep to the hills and upper regions.
                                It seems not. Their forces are nearby. They intend to challenge us
                                here at Philippi, responding to our challenge before we’ve
                                even challenged him.I know how they think, and I understand why they’re doing
                                this. They really wish they were somewhere else, but they want to
                                descend on us, looking fierce so we’ll think
                                they’re brave. But they aren’t.Prepare yourselves, generals. The enemy approaches with great
                                display. They show their bloody heralds of battle, and something
                                must be done immediately.Octavius, lead your forces slowly out to the left side of the
                                level field.I’ll go to the right side. You stay on the left.Why are you defying me in this urgent matter?
