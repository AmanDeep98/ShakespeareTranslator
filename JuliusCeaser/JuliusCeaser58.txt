Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here?No.O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yon gray linesThat fret the clouds are messengers of day.You shall confess that you are both deceived.
(points his sword)
Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,Which is a great way growing on the south,Weighing the youthful season of the year.Some two months hence up higher toward the northHe first presents his fire, and the high eastStands, as the Capitol, directly here.

Give me your hands all over, one by one.
(shakes their hands)
And let us swear our resolution.No, not an oath. If not the face of men,The sufferance of our souls, the time’s
                                abuse—If these be motives weak, break off betimes,And every man hence to his idle bed.So let high-sighted tyranny range onTill each man drop by lottery. But if these—As I am sure they do—bear fire enoughTo kindle cowards and to steel with valorThe melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,What need we any spur but our own causeTo prick us to redress? What other bondThan secret Romans that have spoke the wordAnd will not palter? And what other oathThan honesty to honesty engaged,That this shall be, or we will fall for it?Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,Old feeble carrions and such suffering soulsThat welcome wrongs. Unto bad causes swearSuch creatures as men doubt. But do not stainThe even virtue of our enterprise,Nor th' insuppressive mettle of our spirits,To think that or our cause or our performanceDid need an oath, when every drop of bloodThat every Roman bears—and nobly bears—Is guilty of a several bastardyIf he do break the smallest particleOf any promise that hath passed from him.#LBSFORGOLDHere’s the east. Won’t the dawn come from
                            here?No.Excuse me, sir, it will. These gray lines that lace the clouds are
                                the beginnings of the dawn.You’re both wrong.
                                (pointing his sword) Here, where I
                                point my sword, the sun rises. It’s quite near the south,
                                since it’s still winter. About two months from now, the
                                dawn will break further toward the north, and due east is where the
                                Capitol stands, here.
(coming forward with
                                CASSIUS) Give me your hands, all of
                                you, one by one.
                                (he shakes their hands)
And let us swear to our resolution.No, let’s not swear an oath. If the sad faces of our
                                fellow men, the suffering of our own souls, and the corruption of
                                the present time aren’t enough to motivate us,
                                let’s break it off now and each of us go back to bed. Then
                                we can let this ambitious tyrant continue unchallenged until each of
                                us is killed at his whim. But if we have reasons that are strong
                                enough to ignite cowards into action and to make weak women
                                brave—and I think we do—then, countrymen,
                                what else could we possibly need to spur us to action? What bond do
                                we need other than that of discreet Romans who have said what
                                they’re going to do and won’t back down? And what
                                oath do we need other than that we honest men have told each other
                                that this will happen or we will die trying? Swearing is for
                                priests, cowards, overly cautious men, feeble old people, and those
                                long-suffering weaklings who welcome abuse. Only men whom you
                                wouldn’t trust anyway would swear oaths, and for the worst
                                reasons. Don’t spoil the justness and virtue of our
                                endeavor nor weaken our own irrepressible spirits by thinking that
                                we need a binding oath, when the blood that every noble Roman
                                contains within him would be proven bastard’s blood if he
                                broke the smallest part of any promise he had made.
