Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.Statilius showed the torchlight but, my lord,He came not back. He is or ta'en or slain.Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word.It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.
(whispers to
                                CLITUS)
What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.Peace then! No words.    I’ll
                                rather kill myself.Hark thee, Dardanius.
(whispers to
                                DARDANIUS)
    Shall I do
                                such a deed?O Dardanius!O Clitus!
(aside to
                                DARDANIUS)
What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
(aside to
                                CLITUS)
To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.#LBSFORGOLDCome, last of my friends, rest on this rock.Statilius waved the torchlight at us, but he hasn’t come
                                back. He’s been captured or killed.Sit down, Clitus. Killed, most likely—it’s
                                become a trend. Listen, Clitus.
                                (he whispers to
                                CLITUS)
Who, me, my lord? No, not for all the world.Silence, then! Don’t give it away.I’d rather kill myself.Listen, Dardanius. (he whispers to
                                DARDANIUS)
Would I dare do something like that?Oh Dardanius!Oh Clitus!
(speaking so that only DARDANIUS
                                can hear) What awful thing did Brutus
                                ask of you?
(speaking so that only CLITUS
                                can hear) To kill him, Clitus. Look,
                                he’s meditating on what to do.
