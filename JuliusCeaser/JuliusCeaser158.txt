And let us presently go sit in councilHow covert matters may be best disclosed,And open perils surest answered.Let us do so. For we are at the stakeAnd bayed about with many enemies.And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,Millions of mischiefs.#LBSFORGOLDLet’s immediately organize a council to discuss the best
                                way to find out their secrets and the safest way to confront the
                                threats we’re already faced with.Let’s do that, because we’re hemmed in by many
                                enemies. And even some of the people who smile at us are in fact
                                plotting against us, I’m afraid.
