My heart is thirsty for that noble promise. Fill my cup, Lucius,
                                until the wine overflows it. I cannot drink too much of

                                Philippi and bearing down upon us with a mighty power.I have received letters that say the same.And anything else?That with a series of legal writs, Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus
                                have put a hundred senators to death.
