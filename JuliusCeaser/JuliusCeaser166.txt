That you have wronged me doth appear in this:You have condemned and noted Lucius PellaFor taking bribes here of the Sardians,Wherein my letters, praying on his sideBecause I knew the man, were slighted off.You wronged yourself to write in such a case.In such a time as this it is not meetThat every nice offense should bear his comment.Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourselfAre much condemned to have an itching palm,To sell and mart your offices for goldTo undeservers.   I “an itching
                                palm”!You know that you are Brutus that speak this,Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.The name of Cassius honors this corruption,And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.Chastisement!Remember March, the ides of March remember.Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?#LBSFORGOLDMy evidence that you have wronged me is that you condemned and
                                disgraced Lucius Pella for taking bribes here from the Sardinians,
                                and you ignored my letters, where I argued that he was innocent; I
                                know the man.You wronged yourself to write on behalf of such a man.In a time like this, it doesn’t make sense to criticize
                                every offense.I’ll tell you, Cassius, you yourself have been called
                                greedy and been accused of giving your positions to undeserving men
                                in exchange for gold.Me, “greedy”! You know, if you were anyone
                                other than Brutus, that speech would be your last.The name of Cassius gives credit to these corrupt actions, and so
                                they go unpunished.Unpunished!Remember March, March 15th. Didn’t great Caesar bleed for
                                the sake of justice?
