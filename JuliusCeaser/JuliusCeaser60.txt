But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?I think he will stand very strong with us.Let us not leave him out.    No, by no
                                means.O, let us have him, for his silver hairsWill purchase us a good opinionAnd buy men’s voices to commend our deeds.It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands.Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,But all be buried in his gravity.O, name him not. Let us not break with him,For he will never follow anythingThat other men begin.Then leave him out.#LBSFORGOLDBut what about Cicero? Should we see what he thinks? I think he
                                will stand strong with us.Let’s not leave him out.No, by no means.Yes, we should get his support, for his mature presence will make
                                others think well of us and speak out in support of our actions.
                                They’ll assume that Cicero, with his sound judgment,
                                ordered the actions. His dignified maturity will distract attention
                                from our youth and wildness.No, don’t even mention him. We shouldn’t tell
                                him about our plans. He’ll never follow anything that other
                                men have started.Then leave him out.
