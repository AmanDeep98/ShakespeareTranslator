    Then, with
                                your will, go on.We’ll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.The deep of night is crept upon our talk,And nature must obey necessity,Which we will niggard with a little rest.There is no more to say?    No more. Good
                                night.Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.Lucius!  My gown.    Farewell, good
                                Messala.—Good night, Titinius.—Noble, noble Cassius,Good night and good repose.    O my dear
                                brother,This was an ill beginning of the night.Never come such division ’tween our souls.Let it not, Brutus.#LBSFORGOLDIf that’s what you want, all right. We’ll go
                                forward with you and meet them at Philippi.It’s now late at night, and actions must accommodate
                                bodily needs, which we’ll satisfy with only a short rest.
                                That’s all there is to say.There’s nothing else. Good night. We’ll rise and
                                leave early tomorrow.Lucius!My nightgown.Farewell, good Messala. Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble
                                Cassius, good night and sleep well.Oh my dear brother! This was a bad start to the night.
                                Let’s pray that we never come into conflict like that
                                again. Let’s not, Brutus.
