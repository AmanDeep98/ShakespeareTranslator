Between the acting of a dreadful thingAnd the first motion, all the interim isLike a phantasma or a hideous dream.The genius and the mortal instrumentsAre then in council, and the state of man,Like to a little kingdom, suffers thenThe nature of an insurrection.Sir, ’tis your brother Cassius at the door,Who doth desire to see you.    Is he
                            alone?No, sir, there are more with him.     Do
                                you know them?No, sir. Their hats are plucked about their ears,And half their faces buried in their cloaks,That by no means I may discover themBy any mark of favor.    Let
                                'em enter.They are the faction. O conspiracy,Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by nightWhen evils are most free? O, then by dayWhere wilt thou find a cavern dark enoughTo mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy.Hide it in smiles and affability.#LBSFORGOLDFrom the time when you decide to do something terrible to the
                                moment you do it, everything feels unreal, like a horrible dream.
                                The unconscious and the body work together and rebel against the
                                conscious mind.Sir, it’s your brother-in-law Cassius at the door. He
                                wants to see you.Is he alone?No, sir. There are others with him.Do you know them?No, sir, their hats are pulled down over their ears and their
                                faces are half buried under their cloaks, so there’s no way
                                to tell who they are.Let them in.It’s the faction that wants to kill Caesar. Oh,
                                conspiracy, are you ashamed to show your face even at night, when
                                evil things are most free? If so, when it’s day, where are
                                you going to find a cave dark enough to hide your monstrous face?
                                No, don’t bother to find a cave, conspiracy. Instead, hide
                                your true face behind smiles and friendliness.
