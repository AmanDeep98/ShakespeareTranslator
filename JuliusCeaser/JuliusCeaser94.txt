Come hither, fellow. Which way hast thou been?At mine own house, good lady.What is ’t o'clock?About the ninth hour, lady.Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?Madam, not yet. I go to take my standTo see him pass on to the Capitol.Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?That I have, lady. If it will please CaesarTo be so good to Caesar as to hear me,I shall beseech him to befriend himself.Why, know’st thou any harm’s intended towards
                                him?None that I know will be; much that I fear may chance.Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow.The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.I’ll get me to a place more void, and thereSpeak to great Caesar as he comes along.#LBSFORGOLDCome here, you. Where are you coming from?My own house, good lady.What time is it?Around nine o'clock, madam.Has Caesar gone to the Capital yet?Madam, not yet. I’m going to stand so I can see him pass
                                on the way to the Capitol.You have some plea for Caesar, don’t you?Yes, I do, lady. If it pleases Caesar to be so good to himself as
                                to hear me, I’ll try to get him to do what’s good
                                for him.Why, do you know of any harm intended toward him?Nothing that I know for sure, but a lot that I’m afraid
                                might happen. Good morning to you. The street is narrow here. The
                                crowd that follows Caesar at his heels—senators,
                                justices, common petitioners—will suffocate a feeble man
                                almost to death. I’ll move to a more open place and there
                                speak to great Caesar as he walks past.
