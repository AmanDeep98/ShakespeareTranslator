Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs.And when you do them—    Cassius, be
                                content.Speak your griefs softly. I do know you well.Before the eyes of both our armies here,Which should perceive nothing but love from us,Let us not wrangle. Bid them move away.Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,And I will give you audience.     Pindarus,Bid our commanders lead their charges offA little from this ground.Lucillius, do you the like. And let no manCome to our tent till we have done our conference.Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.#LBSFORGOLDBrutus, your sober expression is a mask to hide the fact that
                                you’ve wronged me. And when you do—Cassius, calm down. We know each other well, and you can speak
                                your grievances quietly. Let’s not argue here in front of
                                both our armies, which ought to see nothing but love between us.
                                Order them to move back. Then, in my tent, you can elaborate on your
                                complaints, and I’ll listen.Pindarus, order our commanders to lead their charges a little ways
                                away from this ground.Lucillius, you do the same, and don’t allow anyone to
                                come into our tent until we’ve finished our conference.
                                Have Lucius and Titinius guard the door.
