O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!Myself have to mine own turned enemy.This ensign here of mine was turning back.I slew the coward and did take it from him.
(indicates his standard)
O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,Who, having some advantage on Octavius,Took it too eagerly. His soldiers fell to spoil,Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.Fly further off, my lord, fly further off.Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord.Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.This hill is far enough.—Look, look, Titinius.Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?They are, my lord.    Titinius, if
                                thou lovest me,Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in himTill he have brought thee up to yonder troopsAnd here again, that I may rest assuredWhether yond troops are friend or enemy.#LBSFORGOLDOh, look, Titinius, look! Those villains, our soldiers, flee!
                                I’ve become an enemy to my own soldiers! This
                                standard-bearer here of mine was running away, so I killed him and
                                took the flag from him.
                                (points to his flag)
Oh, Cassius, Brutus gave the orders too soon. Having an advantage
                                over Octavius, he took it too eagerly, and his soldiers began
                                looting, and now we’re surrounded by Antony’s
                            men.Retreat further, my lord, retreat further. Mark Antony is in your
                                tents, my lord. Therefore you must run, noble Cassius.This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius. Are those my tents
                                on fire?They are, my lord.Titinius, if you love me, get on your horse and spur him on until
                                he’s brought you to those troops and back again, so that I
                                can find out whether those troops are friends or enemies.
