What, Lucius, ho!—I cannot by the progress of the starsGive guess how near to day.—Lucius, I
                                say!—I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.—When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!Called you, my lord?Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.When it is lighted, come and call me here.I will, my lord.It must be by his death, and for my partI know no personal cause to spurn at himBut for the general. He would be crowned.How that might change his nature, there’s the question.It is the bright day that brings forth the adderAnd that craves wary walking. Crown him that,And then I grant we put a sting in himThat at his will he may do danger with.#LBSFORGOLDLucius, are you there? I can’t tell by the position of
                                the stars how near it is to daybreak—Lucius, are you
                                there? I wish I had that weakness, to sleep too soundly. Come on,
                                Lucius! Wake up, I say! Lucius!Did you call me, my lord?Put a candle in my study, Lucius. Call me when it’s
                            lit.I will, my lord.The only way is to kill Caesar. I have no personal reason to
                                strike at him—only the best interest of the people. He
                                wants to be crowned. The question is, how would being king change
                                him? Evil can come from good, just as poisonous snakes tend to come
                                out into the open on bright sunny days—which means we
                                have to walk carefully. If we crown him, I have to admit
                                we’d be giving him the power to do damage.
