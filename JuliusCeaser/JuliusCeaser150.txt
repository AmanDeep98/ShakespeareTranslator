I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,And things unlucky charge my fantasy.I have no will to wander forth of doors,Yet something leads me forth.What is your name?Whither are you going?Where do you dwell?Are you a married man or a bachelor?Answer every man directly.Ay, and briefly.Ay, and wisely.Ay, and truly, you were best.What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell?
Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to answer every
man directly and briefly, wisely and truly—wisely I
                                say, I
am a bachelor.
That’s as much as to say they are fools that marry.
                                You’ll
bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed, directly.
Directly, I am going to Caesar’s funeral.#LBSFORGOLDI dreamed last night that I feasted with Caesar, and unlucky signs
                                overwhelmed my imagination. I have no desire to go outside, yet
                                something leads me there.What’s your name?Where are you going?Where do you live?Are you a married man or a bachelor?Answer all of us, now.Yes, and be brief.Yes, and be wise.Yes, and be truthful, if you know what’s good for
                            you.What’s my name? Where am I going? Where do I live? Am I a
                                married man or a bachelor? Then, to answer every man briefly,
                                wisely, and truthfully—wisely I say, I am a
                            bachelor.You imply that married men are fools. You’ll get a blow
                                from me for that, I think. Go on with what you were
                                saying—right this instant.Right this instant, I’m going to Caesar’s
                                funeral.
