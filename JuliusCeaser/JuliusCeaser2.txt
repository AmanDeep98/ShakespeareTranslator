Hence! Home, you idle creatures get you home!Is this a holiday? What, know you not,Being mechanical, you ought not walkUpon a laboring day without the signOf your profession?—Speak, what trade art thou?Why, sir, a carpenter.Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?What dost thou with thy best apparel on?—You, sir, what trade are you?Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as you
would say, a cobbler.
But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.A trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a safe conscience,
which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.
What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what trade?Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me. Yet, if you be
out, sir, I can mend you.
What mean’st thou by that? “Mend”
                                me, thou saucy
fellow?
#LBSFORGOLDGet out of here! Go home, you lazy men. What, is today a holiday?
                                Don’t you know that working men aren’t supposed to
                                walk around on a workday without wearing their work clothes? You
                                there, speak up. What’s your occupation?I’m a carpenter, sir.Where are your leather apron and your ruler? What are you doing,
                                wearing your best clothes? And you, sir, what’s
                                your trade?Well, compared to a fine workman, you might call me a mere
                                cobbler.But what’s your trade? Answer me
                            straightforwardly.It is a trade, sir, that I practice with a clear conscience. I am
                                a mender of worn soles.What trade, boy? You insolent rascal, what trade?Sir, please, don’t be angry. But if your soles are worn
                                out, I can mend you.What do you mean by that? “Mend” me, you
                                impertinent fellow?!
