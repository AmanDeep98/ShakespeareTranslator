What villain touched his body, that did stab,And not for justice? What, shall one of usThat struck the foremost man of all this worldBut for supporting robbers, shall we nowContaminate our fingers with base bribes,And sell the mighty space of our large honorsFor so much trash as may be graspèd thus?I had rather be a dog and bay the moonThan such a Roman.    Brutus, bait
                                not me.I’ll not endure it. You forget yourselfTo hedge me in. I am a soldier, I,Older in practice, abler than yourselfTo make conditions.Go to. You are not, Cassius.I am.I say you are not.Urge me no more, I shall forget myself.Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.Away, slight man!Is ’t possible?Hear me, for I will speak.Must I give way and room to your rash choler?Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?O ye gods, ye gods, must I endure all this?#LBSFORGOLDWho among us stabbed him for any cause but justice?
                                What—did one of us strike down the most powerful man in
                                the world in order to support robbers? Should we now dirty our
                                fingers with lowly bribes and sell the mighty offices that we hold
                                for whatever money we can get our hands on? I’d rather be a
                                dog and howl at the moon than be that kind of Roman.Brutus, do not provoke me. I will not take it. You’re
                                forgetting yourself when you back me into a corner. I’m a
                                soldier, more experienced than you, and better able to give
                            orders.Get lost! You are not, Cassius.I am.I say you’re not.Don’t provoke me any further or I’ll forget to
                                restrain myself. If you care about your health, you won’t
                                push me any further.Leave, you little man.Is this possible?Listen to me, for I have something to tell you. Am I required to
                                indulge your rash anger? Does a madman scare me when he stares at
                                me?Oh gods, oh gods! Must I endure all this?
