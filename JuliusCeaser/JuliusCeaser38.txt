Those that have known the earth so full of faults.For my part, I have walked about the streets,Submitting me unto the perilous night,And, thus unbracèd, Casca, as you see,Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone.And when the cross blue lightning seemed to openThe breast of heaven, I did present myselfEven in the aim and very flash of it.But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?It is the part of men to fear and trembleWhen the most mighty gods by tokens sendSuch dreadful heralds to astonish us.You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of lifeThat should be in a Roman you do want,Or else you use not. You look pale, and gaze,And put on fear, and cast yourself in wonderTo see the strange impatience of the heavens.But if you would consider the true causeWhy all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,Why old men fool and children calculate,Why all these things change from their ordinanceTheir natures and preformèd facultiesTo monstrous quality—why, you shall findThat heaven hath infused them with these spiritsTo make them instruments of fear and warningUnto some monstrous state.Now could I, Casca, name to thee a manMost like this dreadful night,That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roarsAs doth the lion in the Capitol—#LBSFORGOLDThose who have known how bad things are here on earth. I have
                                walked around the streets, exposing myself to the perilous night,
                                unbuttoned like this, as you see, Casca, baring my chest to the
                                thunderbolt. When the forked blue lightning seemed to break open the
                                sky, I put myself right where I thought it would hit.But why did you tempt the heavens like that? Mankind’s
                                role is to fear and tremble when the almighty gods send warning
                                signals.You’re acting stupid, Casca, and you lack the quick wits
                                that a Roman should have—or else you don’t use
                                them. You go pale, you stare, and you act in awe of the strange
                                disturbance in the heavens. But if you thought about the real reason
                                for all these fires, all these gliding ghosts, for why birds and
                                animals abandon their natural behavior, why old men, fools, and
                                children make predictions, why all sorts of things have departed
                                from the usual course of their natures and become monstrosities,
                                then you’d understand that heaven had them act this way so
                                they would serve as frightening warnings of an unnatural state to
                                come. Right this minute, Casca, I could name a man who’s
                                just like this dreadful night. A man who thunders, throws lightning,
                                splits open graves, and roars like the lion in the Capitol.
