Your brother kings and monarchs of the earthDo all expect that you should rouse yourselfAs did the former lions of your blood.They know your Grace hath cause and means and might;So hath your Highness. Never king of EnglandHad nobles richer, and more loyal subjects,Whose hearts have left their bodies here in EnglandAnd lie pavilioned in the fields of France.Oh, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,With blood and sword and fire to win your right,In aid whereof we of the spiritualtyWill raise your Highness such a mighty sumAs never did the clergy at one timeBring in to any of your ancestors.We must not only arm t' invade the French,But lay down our proportions to defendAgainst the Scot, who will make road upon usWith all advantages.They of those marches, gracious sovereign,Shall be a wall sufficient to defendOur inland from the pilfering borderers.We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,But fear the main intendment of the Scot,Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us.For you shall read that my great-grandfatherNever went with his forces into FranceBut that the Scot on his unfurnished kingdomCame pouring like the tide into a breachWith ample and brim fullness of his force,Galling the gleanèd land with hot assays,Girding with grievous siege castles and towns,That England, being empty of defense,Hath shook and trembled at th' ill neighborhood.#LBSFORGOLDThe other kings throughout the world all expect you to take the offensive, just like your lion-hearted forebears.They know your Grace has justification, as well as the money and military strength. And so you do. No king of England was ever backed by wealthier nobles or more loyal subjects. Their bodies may remain here in England, but their hearts are encamped on the fields of France already.Oh, let their bodies follow, my dear king, to win back what’s rightfully yours with blood and sword and fire. And to that end, we, the clergy, will raise your Highness a sum greater than your ancestors were ever given at any one time.We must not only arm ourselves to invade France, but must also apportion troops to defend against invasion by the Scots, who will see this as a perfect opportunity to attack.Your subjects in the north, gracious sovereign, will provide a wall of defense against Scottish thieves across the border.I don’t mean merely bands of thieves. What we have to worry about is a full-scale invasion from Scotland—always an unreliable neighbor. You’ll find that my great-grandfather never went to war with France without Scotland making an attack on his undefended kingdom, pouring in full force like the tide through a gap in a dyke, troubling the depleted country with violent attacks, and laying siege to towns and castles. The whole of England, being unprotected, trembled with fear.
