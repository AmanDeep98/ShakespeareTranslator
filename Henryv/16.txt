Of what your reverence shall incite us to.Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,How you awake our sleeping sword of war.We charge you in the name of God, take heed,For never two such kingdoms did contendWithout much fall of blood, whose guiltless dropsAre every one a woe, a sore complaint'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swordsThat make such waste in brief mortality.Under this conjuration, speak, my lord,For we will hear, note, and believe in heartThat what you speak is in your conscience washedAs pure as sin with baptism.Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peersThat owe yourselves, your lives, and servicesTo this imperial throne. There is no barTo make against your Highness' claim to FranceBut this, which they produce from Pharamond:
