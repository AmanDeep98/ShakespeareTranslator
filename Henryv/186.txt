Old men forget; yet all shall be forgotBut he’ll remember with advantagesWhat feats he did that day. Then shall our names,Familiar in his mouth as household words,Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,Be in their flowing cups freshly remembered.This story shall the good man teach his son,And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,From this day to the ending of the world,But we in it shall be rememberèd—We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;For he today that sheds his blood with meShall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,This day shall gentle his condition;And gentlemen in England now abedShall think themselves accursed they were not here,And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaksThat fought with us upon Saint Crispin’s day.My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed.The French are bravely in their battles set,And will with all expedience charge on us.All things are ready if our minds be so.Perish the man whose mind is backward now!Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?God’s will, my liege, would you and I alone,Without more help, could fight this royal battle!#LBSFORGOLDgo by, from this day to the end of time, without our being remembered: we few, we happy few, we band of brothers—for whoever sheds his blood with me today shall be my brother. However humble his birth, this day shall grant him nobility. And men back in English now safe in their beds will curse themselves for not having been here, and think less of their own manhood when they listen to the stories of those who fought with us here on St. Crispin’s Day.My sovereign lord, join us quickly: the French are all arrayed in battle formation and will charge us at any moment.We’re ready if our minds are ready.Let any man perish who isn’t ready now!You don’t wish we had more help from England anymore, cousin?God Almighty, my liege, I wish that you and I could fight this royal battle all alone.
