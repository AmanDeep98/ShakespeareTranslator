But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring inWonder to wait on treason and on murder,And whatsoever cunning fiend it wasThat wrought upon thee so preposterouslyHath got the voice in hell for excellence.All other devils that suggest by treasonsDo botch and bungle up damnationWith patches, colors, and with forms being fetchedFrom glist'ring semblances of piety.But he that tempered thee bade thee stand up,Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.If that same demon that hath gulled thee thusShould with his lion gait walk the whole world,He might return to vasty Tartar backAnd tell the legions “I can never winA soul so easy as that Englishman’s.”Oh, how hast thou with jealousy infectedThe sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?Why, so didst thou. Seem they grave and learnèd?Why, so didst thou. Come they of noble family?Why, so didst thou. Seem they religious?Why, so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,Garnished and decked in modest complement,Not working with the eye without the ear,And but in purgèd judgment trusting neither?Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem.And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blotTo mark the full-fraught man and best enduedWith some suspicion. I will weep for thee,For this revolt of thine methinks is likeAnother fall of man.—Their faults are open.Arrest them to the answer of the law,And God acquit them of their practices.#LBSFORGOLDand patches of righteousness. But the devil that tempted you gave you no reason why you should commit treason other than to win the name of traitor. The demon who seduced you could stride the world over with the proud gait of a lion, could return to hell and tell the devil’s legions, “I will never win another soul as easily as I won that Englishman’s.” How you have poisoned my faith in people! Now I am suspicious of everyone. Are there men who appear dutiful? Why, so did you. Are there those who seem serious and knowledgeable? Why, so did you. Do they come from good families? Why, so did you. Do they seem religious? Why, so did you. Do they live in moderation, free from excessive emotion—stable rather than changing their minds constantly—tastefully dressed, not merely seeing but also listening, and trusting no impression without confirmation? That’s how sound a man you appeared. Your fall has left a blot that opens even the best and brightest to suspicion. You have broken my heart. This treachery of yours is like the second Fall of man“Fall of man” refers to Adam and Eve’s first sin—eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, which caused them to lose their innocence and be expelled from Eden.Fall of man.—Their crimes are revealed. Arrest and punish them according to the law, and may God pardon them for what they would have done.
