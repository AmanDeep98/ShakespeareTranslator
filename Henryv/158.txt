It sorts well with your fierceness.Captain Fluellen.So. In the name of Jesu Christ, speak fewer. It is the greatest
admiration in the universal world when the true and
aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept. If
you would take the pains but to examine the wars of
Pompey the Great, you shall find, I warrant you, that there
is no tiddle toddle nor pibble babble in Pompey’s camp. I
warrant you, you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and
the cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety of it and
the modesty of it to be otherwise.
Why, the enemy is loud. You hear him all night.If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb, is
it meet, think you, that we should also, look you, be an ass
and a fool and a prating coxcomb, in your own conscience,
now?
I will speak lower.I pray you and beseech you that you will.Though it appear a little out of fashion,There is much care and valor in this Welshman.#LBSFORGOLDThe name suits your fierceness.Captain Fluellen!In the name of Jesus Christ, keep it down! It never ceases to amaze me the way people ignore the correct, traditional principles and rules of war. If you would take the trouble to study the tactics of Pompey the Great, I can tell you that you would find no tittle-tattle or pibble-pabble in Pompey’s camp. I tell you, you would find the rituals of war and, I promise you, its ceremonies and its solicitudes and its forms and its gravity and its discipline all to be quite counter to all this noise.But the enemy is loud. You can hear them all night long.And if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating idiot, does that mean, you think, that we should also be an ass and a fool and a prating idiot? Think about it.I will lower my voice.I’d be very glad if you would.Though he seems a little old-fashioned, there is much care and courage in this Welshman.
