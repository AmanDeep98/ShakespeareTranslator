I tell thee truly, herald,I know not if the day be ours or no,For yet a many of your horsemen peerAnd gallop o'er the field.The day is yours.Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!What is this castle called that stands hard by?They call it Agincourt.Then call we this the field of Agincourt,Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.Your grandfather of famous memory, an’t please your
Majesty, and your great-uncle Edward the Plack Prince of
Wales, as I have read in the chronicles, fought a most prave
pattle here in France.
They did, Fluellen.Your Majesty says very true. If your Majesties is
remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a
garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their
Monmouth caps, which, your Majesty know, to this hour is
an honorable badge of the service. And I do believe your
Majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy’s
day.
#LBSFORGOLDI’ll be honest with you, herald: I don’t even know who won the battle. I still see many of your horsemen galloping across the field.You won it.God, not our strength, be praised! What is the name of the castle that stands over there?Agincourt.Then we’ll call this the Battle of Agincourt, fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.If I may say so, your Majesty, your famous grandfather and your great-uncle Edward, the Black Prince of Wales—or so I’ve read in the history books—fought a very brave battle here in France.They did, Fluellen.Your Majesty is quite right. If your Majesties recall it, the Welsh fought very valiantly in a garden where there were leeks growing, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps which, your Majesty knows, is to this day a badge of honorable military service. I do believe your Majesty takes no shame in wearing the leek on Saint Davy’s Day.
