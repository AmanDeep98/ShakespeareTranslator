Ô diable!

Ô seigneur! Le jour est perdu, tout est erdu!

Mort de ma vie, all is confounded, all!Reproach and everlasting shameSits mocking in our plumes.
Ô méchante Fortune!
Do not run away.Why, all our ranks are broke.O perdurable shame! Let’s stab ourselves.Be these the wretches that we played at dice for?Is this the king we sent to for his ransom?Shame, and eternal shame, nothing but shame!Let us die. In once more! Back again!And he that will not follow Bourbon now,Let him go hence, and with his cap in handLike a base pander hold the chamber door,Whilst by a slave, no gentler than my dog,His fairest daughter is contaminate.Disorder, that hath spoiled us, friend us now.Let us on heaps go offer up our lives.#LBSFORGOLDO, hell!O Lord, the day is lost! All is lost!Dear God! All is lost, all! Regret and everlasting shame sit on our helmets, mocking us.What stinking luck! Do not run away.Our men have all broken ranks.O, everlasting shame! Let’s fall on our swords. Are these the wretches that we threw dice for?Is this the king we offered to ransom?Shame, eternal shame, and nothing but shame! Let us die honorably. Back into the fray once again! He who will not follow me now, let him depart and stand in the doorway like a pimp, cap in hand, while some slave, no nobler than my dog, violates his daughter.Maybe we can benefit from the same chaos that has defeated us. Let’s go offer up our lives en masse.
