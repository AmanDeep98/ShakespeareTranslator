I doubt not that, since we are well-persuadedWe carry not a heart with us from henceThat grows not in a fair consent with ours,Nor leave not one behind that doth not wishSuccess and conquest to attend on us.Never was monarch better feared and lovedThan is your Majesty. There’s not, I think, a subjectThat sits in heart-grief and uneasinessUnder the sweet shade of your government.True. Those that were your father’s enemiesHave steeped their galls in honey, and do serve youWith hearts create of duty and of zeal.We therefore have great cause of thankfulnessAnd shall forget the office of our handSooner than quittance of desert and meritAccording to the weight and worthiness.So service shall with steelèd sinews toil,And labor shall refresh itself with hopeTo do your Grace incessant services.We judge no less.—Uncle of Exeter,Enlarge the man committed yesterdayThat railed against our person. We considerIt was excess of wine that set him on,And on his more advice we pardon him.That’s mercy, but too much security.Let him be punished, sovereign, lest exampleBreed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.Oh, let us yet be merciful.#LBSFORGOLDI have no doubt about that, since I know there isn’t a man among us who isn’t with me wholeheartedly, or a soul left behind who doesn’t wish us success and conquest.There never was a monarch better feared and loved than yourself, your Majesty. I don’t think there’s a single unhappy subject living under the protection of your government.True. Those who were bitter enemies of your father in his time have turned their bitterness to sweetness, serving you loyally and wholeheartedly.Yes, I have great cause to be thankful. I’m more likely to forget how to use my own hand than how to reward virtue and merit as they deserve.And so your subjects serve you all the more energetically, hopeful of success and reward.I expect no less. Uncle of Exeter, release the man who was arrested yesterday for railing against me. I believe he only did it because he drank too much, and now that he’s had a chance to think about his actions, I can pardon him.That’s merciful but a bit careless. He should be punished, your Majesty. If we tolerate such behavior, we’re in danger of encouraging it.Oh, let us be merciful anyway.
