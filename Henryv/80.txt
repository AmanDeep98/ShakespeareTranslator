For us, we will consider of this further.Tomorrow shall you bear our full intentBack to our brother England.For the Dauphin,I stand here for him. What to him from England?Scorn and defiance, slight regard, contempt,And anything that may not misbecomeThe mighty sender, doth he prize you at.Thus says my king: an if your father’s HighnessDo not, in grant of all demands at large,Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty,He’ll call you to so hot an answer of itThat caves and womby vaultages of FranceShall chide your trespass and return your mockIn second accent of his ordinance.Say, if my father render fair return,It is against my will, for I desireNothing but odds with England. To that end,As matching to his youth and vanity,I did present him with the Paris balls.He’ll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,Were it the mistress court of mighty Europe.And be assured you’ll find a difference,As we his subjects have in wonder found,Between the promise of his greener daysAnd these he masters now. Now he weighs timeEven to the utmost grain. That you shall readIn your own losses, if he stay in France.Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full.#LBSFORGOLDI’ll think it over. Tomorrow, I’ll let you know what I’ve decided and what answer you should deliver to the king of England.Regarding the Dauphin, you can speak to me. What’s the message from the English king?Scorn and defiance, indifference, contempt, and any insult that wouldn’t disgrace the mighty sender—that’s the value he puts on you. And my king goes on: if your royal father does not sweeten the bitter insult you sent my king and grant all our demands, Henry’s artillery will give you so resounding an answer that the very caves and vaulted cathedrals of France shall echo your mocking of him back in your face.Say this: if my father sends a friendly answer, it is against my will. I want nothing but conflict with England. To that end, I presented him with the tennis balls, the perfect expression of his inexperience and frivolity.He’ll make your palace tremble for this insult, even if it were the mightiest in all of Europe. And, make no mistake, you’ll find, as we his subjects have, an amazing difference between the king as a young man and the way he is now. Now he uses his time wisely, as you will see by your own casualties, if he remains in France.We’ll give you an answer tomorrow.
