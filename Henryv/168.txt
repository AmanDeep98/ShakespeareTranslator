I embrace it.How shall I know thee again?Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my bonnet.
Then, if ever thou dar’st acknowledge it, I will make it my
quarrel.
Here’s my glove. Give me another of thine.There.This will I also wear in my cap. If ever thou come to me and
say, after tomorrow, “This is my glove,” by this hand I will
take thee a box on the ear.
If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.Thou dar’st as well be hanged.Well, I will do it, though I take thee in the king’s company.Keep thy word. Fare thee well.Be friends, you English fools, be friends. We have French
quarrels enough, if you could tell how to reckon.
Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to one
they will beat us, for they bear them on their shoulders. But
it is no English treason to cut French crowns, and tomorrow
the king himself will be a clipper.
#LBSFORGOLDI’m game.How will I recognize you in the future?Give me some trinket of yours, and I will wear it in my hat. Then, if you dare to acknowledge it, I’ll take up my quarrel with you.Here’s my glove; give me one of yours.Here.I’ll also wear this in my cap. If you come to me after tomorrow and say, “That’s my glove,” I swear by this hand, I will take it and give you a box on the ear.If I ever see it, I will challenge you.You may as well undertake to be hanged.I’ll do it even if I find you in the company of the king himself.Keep your word. Farewell.Be friends, you English fools, be friends: we have enough enemies on the French side, if either of you could count.Indeed, the French can bet twenty French crowns to one that they’ll beat us, they have such an army. But it’s no treason for an Englishman to cut off a French crown—a head, I mean—and tomorrow the king himself will do some snipping.
