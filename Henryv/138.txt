Mine was not bridled.Oh, then belike she was old and gentle, and you rode, like
a kern of Ireland, your French hose off and in your straight
strossers.
You have good judgment in horsemanship.Be warned by me, then: they that ride so, and ride not
warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have my horse to my
mistress.
I had as lief have my mistress a jade.I tell thee, Constable, my mistress wears his own hair.I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my
mistress.
“Le chien est retourné à son propre vomissement, et la truie
lavée au bourbier.” Thou mak’st use of anything.
Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress, or any such
proverb so little kin to the purpose.
My Lord Constable, the armor that I saw in your tent
tonight, are those stars or suns upon it?
Stars, my lord.Some of them will fall tomorrow, I hope.#LBSFORGOLDMine wasn’t wearing a bridle.Oh, then I guess she was old and gentle, and you rode barelegged, like an Irish yokel.You’re a good judge of horsemanship.Take a tip from me, then. Those who don’t take care when they ride often find themselves thrown into a messy situation. I’d rather have my horse than a mistress.I’d prefer to keep my mistress rather than some lame horse.I’ll tell you this, Constable, my mistress has his own hair.I could make the same boast even if I had a pig as my mistress.“The dog returns to its own vomit, and the newly washed sow to its mud puddle.”You’d take anything for a mistress.At least I don’t have a horse for my mistress—or a saying so beside the point.My Lord Constable, are those stars or suns I saw on the armor in your tent tonight?Stars, my lord.I hope some will fall off tomorrow.
