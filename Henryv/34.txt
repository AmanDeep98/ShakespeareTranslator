We hope to make the sender blush at it.Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hourThat may give furth'rance to our expedition;For we have now no thought in us but France,Save those to God, that run before our business.Therefore let our proportions for these warsBe soon collected, and all things thought uponThat may with reasonable swiftness addMore feathers to our wings. For, God before,We’ll chide this Dauphin at his father’s door.Therefore let every man now task his thought,That this fair action may on foot be brought.#LBSFORGOLDI hope to make the sender blush for it. Now, lords, don’t let slip any opportunity that might be advantageous for our expedition. My thoughts are now bent entirely on France—except my thoughts about God, who takes precedence over this undertaking. Therefore, let’s set about mustering the requisite number of troops and give consideration to anything that can be expected to speed our enterprise. For, with God on our side, we’ll chastise this prince on his father’s own doorstep. Therefore, let every man give some thought to how this noble expedition may be undertaken.
