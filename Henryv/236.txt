Do we all holy rites.Let there be sung Non nobis and Te Deum,
The dead with charity enclosed in clay,And then to Calais, and to England then,Where ne'er from France arrived more happy men.#LBSFORGOLDWeâ€™ll perform all the holy rites. Let Non nobis and Te Deum be sung, and let the dead be buried properly. Then on to Calais and from there to England. There have never been more fortunate men than we to return from France.
