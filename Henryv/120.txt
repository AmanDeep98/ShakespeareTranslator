How now, Captain Fluellen? Come you from the bridge?I assure you, there is very excellent services committed at
the bridge.
Is the duke of Exeter safe?The duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon,
and a man that I love and honor with my soul and my heart
and my duty and my life and my living and my uttermost
power. He is not, God be praised and blessed, any hurt in
the world, but keeps the bridge most valiantly, with
excellent discipline. There is an aunchient lieutenant there
at the pridge. I think in my very conscience he is as valiant
a man as Mark Antony, and he is a man of no estimation in
the world, but I did see him do as gallant service.
