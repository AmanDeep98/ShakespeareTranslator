Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.There is one goat for you. (strikes him) Will you be so good,
scald knave, as eat it?
Base Trojan, thou shalt die.You say very true, scald knave, when God’s will is. I will
desire you to live in the meantime and eat your victuals.
Come, there is sauce for it. (strikes him) You called me
yesterday “mountain squire,” but I will make you today a
squire of low degree. I pray you, fall to. If you can mock a
leek, you can eat a leek.
Enough, Captain. You have astonished him.I say I will make him eat some part of my leek, or I will peat
his pate four days.—Bite, I pray you. It is good for your
green wound and your ploody coxcomb.
Must I bite?Yes, certainly, and out of doubt and out of question, too,
and ambiguities.
By this leek, I will most horribly revenge. I eat and eat, I
swear—
Eat, I pray you. Will you have some more sauce to your
leek? There is not enough leek to swear by.
Quiet thy cudgel. Thou dost see I eat.#LBSFORGOLDNot for Cadwallader and all his goats.Here’s a goat for you. (strikes him with a club) Will you be good enough to eat it, mangy rascal?Dissolute lowlife, you shall die.That’s very true, mangy rascal, when it pleases God. Meanwhile, I’d be gratified if you’d live and eat your food. Come, here’s some sauce to go with it. (strikes him with his club) Yesterday you called me “mountain squire.” Today I’ll make you squire of the low ground. Go on, eat up. If you can mock a leek, you can eat a leek.Enough, Captain. You’ve stunned him.I tell you, I’ll either make him eat some part of this leek or give him a four-day head-bashing.—Go on, bite. It’s good for your fresh wound and your bloody noggin.Must I bite?Yes, absolutely, no question or ambiguity about it.By this leek, I swear I’ll make you pay for this. (FLUELLEN threatens to strike him) Okay, okay, I’m eating it—Please do. Would you like some more sauce to go with it? There isn’t enough leek left for you to swear on.Lay off, already! Can’t you see I’m eating?
