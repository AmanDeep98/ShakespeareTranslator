We never valued this poor seat of EnglandAnd therefore, living hence, did give ourselfTo barbarous license, as ’tis ever commonThat men are merriest when they are from home.But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,Be like a king, and show my sail of greatnessWhen I do rouse me in my throne of France,For that I have laid by my majestyAnd plodded like a man for working days.But I will rise there with so full a gloryThat I will dazzle all the eyes of France,Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.And tell the pleasant prince this mock of hisHath turned his balls to gun-stones, and his soulShall stand sore chargèd for the wasteful vengeanceThat shall fly with them; for many a thousand widowsShall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands,Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down,And some are yet ungotten and unbornThat shall have cause to curse the Dauphin’s scorn.But this lies all within the will of God,To whom I do appeal, and in whose nameTell you the Dauphin I am coming on,To venge me as I may and to put forthMy rightful hand in a well-hallowed cause.So get you hence in peace. And tell the DauphinHis jest will savor but of shallow witWhen thousands weep more than did laugh at it.—Convey them with safe conduct.—Fare you well. This was a merry message.#LBSFORGOLDsuch glory that I’ll dazzle all the eyes of France. I’ll shine so brightly that even the Dauphin will be
