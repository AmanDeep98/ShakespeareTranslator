'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon his own
head. The king is not to answer it.
I do not desire he should answer for me, and yet I determine
to fight lustily for him.
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully, but when our
throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we ne'er the wiser.
If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.You pay him then. That’s a perilous shot out of an elder
gun, that a poor and private displeasure can do against a
monarch. You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice
with fanning in his face with a peacock’s feather. You’ll
“never trust his word after.” Come, ’tis a foolish saying.
Your reproof is something too round. I should be angry
with you if the time were convenient.
Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.#LBSFORGOLDIt’s clear, every man must take responsibility for the manner of his own death. The king is not responsible for it.I don’t expect him to answer for me, and yet I’m determined to fight vigorously for him.I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.Sure, he said so to make us fight cheerfully. But when our throats are cut, he could be ransomed without our being any the wiser.If I live to see it, I’ll never trust his word again.Yeah, right, go get him. That’s a lame threat from a toy gun, a poor individual’s private displeasure with a monarch. You may as well try to turn the sun to ice by fanning its face with a peacock feather. You’ll “never trust his word again.” Come on, that was a stupid thing to say.Your scolding is somewhat overblown. I’d be angry with you if the occasion allowed.Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.
