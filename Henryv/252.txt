My duty to you both, on equal love,Great kings of France and England. That I have laboredWith all my wits, my pains, and strong endeavors,To bring your most imperial MajestiesUnto this bar and royal interview,Your mightiness on both parts best can witness.Since, then, my office hath so far prevailedThat face to face and royal eye to eyeYou have congreeted. Let it not disgrace meIf I demand before this royal viewWhat rub or what impediment there isWhy that the naked, poor, and mangled peace,Dear nurse of arts, plenties, and joyful births,Should not in this best garden of the world,Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,Corrupting in its own fertility.Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,Unprunèd, dies. Her hedges, even-pleached,Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,Put forth disordered twigs. Her fallow leasThe darnel, hemlock, and rank fumitoryDoth root upon, while that the coulter rustsThat should deracinate such savagery.The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forthThe freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover,Wanting the scythe, withal uncorrected, rank,Conceives by idleness, and nothing teemsBut hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burrs,Losing both beauty and utility.And as our vineyards, fallows, meads, and hedges,Defective in their natures, grow to wildness,Even so our houses and ourselves and childrenHave lost, or do not learn for want of time,The sciences that should become our country,But grow like savages, as soldiers will#LBSFORGOLDGreat kings of France and England, I owe you both equal service and loyalty. Your Highnesses can both attest to the fact that I’ve strived mightily, with all my wits and energy, to bring about this royal meeting between you two imperial Majesties. Since I have succeeded to the point of bringing you face to face and eye to eye, don’t take it ill if I formally demand to know, before this royal congregation, what obstacle or impediment prevents the poor fragile, mangled peace, the mother of arts and joyous births, from showing her lovely face in this most fertile garden of the world, our fair France? Alas, she has been too long exiled from France, whose crops all lie in heaps, rotting with ripeness. Her grapes, which make the wine that cheers our hearts, die unpruned on the vines. Her once-trimmed hedges, like prisoners with wild, untended hair, put forth unruly twigs. Her fallow fields are overgrown with weeds, while the blade that should uproot such wilderness lies rusting. The level meadow, where the freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover once grew, has become useless: unmowed, it grows to seed, so that nothing springs up but weeds, rough thistles, barren plants, and burs.And just as our vineyards, fallow fields, meadows, and hedges, which grow improperly if left to themselves, run riot, so our families and ourselves and our
