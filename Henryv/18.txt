Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peersThat owe yourselves, your lives, and servicesTo this imperial throne. There is no barTo make against your Highness' claim to FranceBut this, which they produce from Pharamond:
“In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant”
(No woman shall succeed in Salic land),Which Salic land the French unjustly glozeTo be the realm of France, and PharamondThe founder of this law and female bar.Yet their own authors faithfully affirmThat the land Salic is in Germany,Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe,Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,There left behind and settled certain French,Who, holding in disdain the German womenFor some dishonest manners of their life,Established then this law: to wit, no femaleShould be inheritrix in Salic land,Which “Salic,” as I said, ’twixt Elbe and SalaIs at this day in Germany called Meissen.Then doth it well appear the Salic lawWas not devisèd for the realm of France,Nor did the French possess the Salic landUntil four hundred one and twenty yearsAfter defunction of King Pharamond,Idly supposed the founder of this law;Who died within the year of our redemptionFour hundred twenty-six; and Charles the GreatSubdued the Saxons and did seat the FrenchBeyond the river Sala in the yearEight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,King Pepin, which deposèd Childeric,Did, as heir general, being descendedOf Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,Make claim and title to the crown of France.Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crownOf Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir maleOf the true line and stock of Charles the Great,To find his title with some shows of truth,Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,Conveyed himself as th' heir to th' Lady Lingare,Daughter to Charlemagne, who was the sonTo Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the sonOf Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,Could not keep quiet in his conscience,Wearing the crown of France, till satisfiedThat fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine,By the which marriage the line of Charles the GreatWas reunited to the crown of France.So that, as clear as is the summer’s sun,King Pepin’s title and Hugh Capet’s claim,King Lewis his satisfaction, all appearTo hold in right and title of the female.#LBSFORGOLDintended for the realm of France. Nor did the French possess the Salic land until four hundred twenty-one years after the death of King Pharamond, incorrectly thought to be the founder of the law. He died in the year 426, and Charles the Great conquered the Saxons and settled Frenchmen in the region beyond the river Sala in the year 805. Besides, according to the French historians, King Pepin, who deposed Childeric, based his own claim to the crown of France on his descent from Blithild, the daughter of King Clothair. Another case: Hugh Capet, who usurped the crown from Charles the duke of Lorraine—sole male heir in a direct line from Charles the Great—passed himself off as heir to Lady Lingare, daughter of Charlemagne, who was the son of Lewis the Emperor (who was the son of Charles the Great), in order to give his claim to the throne more validity (though, in fact, the claim was completely false and worthless). Another case: King Lewis the Tenth, who was sole heir to the usurper Capet, could not rest easy as king until he was assured that Queen Isabel, his grandmother, was a direct descendent of the Lady Ermengare, daughter of the aforementioned Charles duke of Lorraine, by which marriage the line of Charles the Great was reunited with the throne of France. Thus, it should be clear as day that King Pepin’s title, Hugh Capet’s claim, and the resolution of King Lewis’s doubts all plainly derive from the female.
