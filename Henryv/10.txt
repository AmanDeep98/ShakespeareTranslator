The strawberry grows underneath the nettle,And wholesome berries thrive and ripen bestNeighbored by fruit of baser quality;And so the Prince obscured his contemplationUnder the veil of wildness, which, no doubt,Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,Unseen yet crescive in his faculty.It must be so, for miracles are ceased,And therefore we must needs admit the meansHow things are perfected.But, my good lord,How now for mitigation of this billUrged by the Commons? Doth his MajestyIncline to it or no?He seems indifferent,Or rather swaying more upon our partThan cherishing th' exhibitors against us;For I have made an offer to his Majesty—Upon our spiritual convocationAnd in regard of causes now in hand,Which I have opened to his Grace at large,As touching France—to give a greater sumThan ever at one time the clergy yetDid to his predecessors part withal.How did this offer seem received, my lord?#LBSFORGOLDStrawberries grow underneath nettle plants, and berries grow best when they’re planted next to inferior fruit. In the same way, the prince hid his serious side under the guise of wild behavior. Just like summer grass, which grows fastest during the night, this sober quality was able to grow and thrive all the better for being undetected.That must be it, because the age of miracles is passed, and we have to find reasonable explanations for why these things happen.But tell me, my lord: as to the softening of this bill proposed by the House of Commons, does his Majesty favor it or not?He seems neutral, perhaps leaning a little more toward our side than that of our opponents—since I’ve made his Majesty an offer, following a meeting with our fellow bishops. The offer regards certain matters having to do with France that his Grace and I have been discussing. My offer would involve us giving him a greater sum than the clergy ever gave at one time to any of his predecessors.How did he take the offer, my lord?
