O'erblows the filthy and contagious cloudsOf heady murder, spoil, and villainy.If not, why, in a moment look to seeThe blind and bloody soldier with foul handDesire the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters,Your fathers taken by the silver beardsAnd their most reverend heads dashed to the walls,Your naked infants spitted upon pikesWhiles the mad mothers with their howls confusedDo break the clouds, as did the wives of JewryAt Herod’s bloody-hunting slaughtermen.What say you? Will you yield and this avoidOr, guilty in defense, be thus destroyed?Our expectation hath this day an end.The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated,Returns us that his powers are yet not readyTo raise so great a siege. Therefore, great King,We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.Enter our gates, dispose of us and ours,For we no longer are defensible.Open your gates.Come, uncle Exeter,Go you and enter Harfleur. There remainAnd fortify it strongly 'gainst the French.Use mercy to them all for us, dear uncle,The winter coming on and sickness growingUpon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest;Tomorrow for the march are we addressed.#LBSFORGOLDgrief-crazed mothers tear the clouds with their loud cries, just as the women of Judea did when Herod slaughtered their infants. What do you say? Will you surrender and avoid all this or be called to account for the destruction of this town?Today our hopes are at an end. The Dauphin, whom we asked for reinforcements, sends back the answer that he’s not yet in a position to raise so great an army. Therefore, great king, we surrender our town and lives to your kind mercy. Enter our gates and do as you like with us and our possessions, for we cannot defend ourselves any longer.Open your gates.Come, uncle Exeter, enter Harfleur. Stay there and fortify it well against the French. Deal with them all mercifully on my behalf, dear uncle. Meanwhile, with winter coming on and sickness growing among our troops, we’ll withdraw to Calais. Tonight in Harfleur we will be your guest; tomorrow we’ll march on.
