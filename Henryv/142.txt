'Tis midnight. I’ll go arm myself.The Dauphin longs for morning.He longs to eat the English.I think he will eat all he kills.By the white hand of my lady, he’s a gallant prince.Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.He is simply the most active gentleman of France.Doing is activity, and he will still be doing.He never did harm that I heard of.Nor will do none tomorrow. He will keep that good name
still.
I know him to be valiant.I was told that by one that knows him better than you.What’s he?Marry, he told me so himself; and he said he cared not who
knew it.
He needs not. It is no hidden virtue in him.#LBSFORGOLDIt’s midnight.
