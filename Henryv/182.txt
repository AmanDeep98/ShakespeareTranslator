Where is the king?The king himself is rode to view their battle.Of fighting men they have full threescore thousand.There’s five to one. Besides, they all are fresh.God’s arm strike with us! 'Tis a fearful odds.God be wi' you, princes all. I’ll to my charge.If we no more meet till we meet in heaven,Then joyfully, my noble Lord of Bedford,My dear Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter,And my kind kinsman, warriors all, adieu.Farewell, good Salisbury, and good luck go with thee.Farewell, kind lord. Fight valiantly today.And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,For thou art framed of the firm truth of valor.He is as full of valor as of kindness,Princely in both.#LBSFORGOLDWhere is the king?The king rode out alone to view their troops.They have fully sixty thousand fighting men.That’s five to one. Besides, they’re fresh.May God’s arm strike on our side! These are frightening odds. God be with all of you, princes. I’ll go and join my men. If we don’t meet again before we meet in heaven, still we’ll meet joyfully. My noble Lord of Bedford, my dear Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter, and my kind kinsmen, warriors all, adieu.Farewell, good Salisbury; and may good luck go with you.Farewell, kind lord. Fight valiantly today. But then I do you wrong to say as much, since you are the very embodiment of bravery.He is as full of courage as of kindness, princely in both.
