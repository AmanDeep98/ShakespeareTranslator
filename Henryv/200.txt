Suivez-vous le grand capitaine.
I did never know so full a voice issue from so empty a heart.
But the saying is true: “The empty vessel makes the
greatest sound.” Bardolph and Nym had ten times more
valor than this roaring devil i' th' old play, that everyone
may pare his nails with a wooden dagger, and they are both
hanged, and so would this be if he durst steal any thing
adventurously. I must stay with the lackeys with the
luggage of our camp. The French might have a good prey of
us if he knew of it, for there is none to guard it but boys.

(speaking in French) Follow the mighty captain.I never heard so loud a voice issue from such an empty heart. It’s true what they say: “The empty vessel makes the greatest sound.” Bardolph and Nym had ten times more courage than this roaring stage villain, whose nails any Joe could cut with a wooden dagger, but they are both hanged. So would this man if he had the nerve to steal anything bravely. I have to stay with the servants, who are with our camp’s luggage. We’re sitting ducks for the French, if they only knew it, for there is no one guarding it but boys.
