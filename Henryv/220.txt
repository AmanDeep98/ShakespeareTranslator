What think you, Captain Fluellen, is it fit this soldier keep
his oath?
He is a craven and a villain else, an ’t please your Majesty,
in my conscience.
It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort, quite from
the answer of his degree.
Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is, as Lucifer
and Beelzebub himself, it is necessary, look your Grace,
that he keep his vow and his oath. If he be perjured, see you
now, his reputation is as arrant a villain and a Jack Sauce as
ever his black shoe trod upon God’s ground and His earth,
in my conscience, la.
Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou meet’st the fellow.So I will, my liege, as I live.Who serv’st thou under?Under Captain Gower, my liege.Gower is a good captain, and is good knowledge and
literatured in the wars.
Call him hither to me, soldier.I will, my liege.#LBSFORGOLDWhat do you say, Captain Fluellen? Should this soldier keep his oath?If I may say so, your Majesty, as I see it he would be a coward and a villain not to.It may be that his antagonist is a gentleman of very high degree, quite outside of his own sphere.Even if he were as important a man as the devil—as Lucifer or Beelzebub himself—he’s required, see, your Grace, to keep his vow. If he backs down, he’ll become as notorious a villain and as saucy a Jack as ever walked on God’s earth, in my opinion.Then keep your vow, fellow, when you meet the man.So I will, my liege. I swear on my life.Whom do you serve under?Under Captain Gower, my liege.Gower is a good captain, and is well versed and well read in the wars.Have him come to me here, soldier.I will, my liege.
