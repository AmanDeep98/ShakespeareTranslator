Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the mines;
the duke of Gloucester would speak with you.
To the mines? Tell you the duke it is not so good to come to
the mines, for, look you, the mines is not according to the
disciplines of the war. The concavities of it is not sufficient,
for, look you, th' athversary, you may discuss unto the
duke, look you, is digt himself four yard under the
countermines. By Cheshu, I think he will plow up all if
there is not better directions.
The duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the siege is
given, is altogether directed by an Irishman, a very valiant
gentleman, i' faith.
It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?I think it be.By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world. I will verify as much
in his beard. He has no more directions in the true
disciplines of the wars, look you, of the Roman disciplines,
than is a puppy dog.
Here he comes, and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with
him.
#LBSFORGOLDCaptain Fluellen, you must come straight to the tunnels. The duke of Gloucester wants a word with you.The tunnels! Tell the duke I’m not so keen to come to the tunnels. For the tunnels, see, are not strictly in accordance with the proper practice of war. They’re not deep enough. For the enemy, see—and you can explain this to the duke, see—has dug its own tunnels four yards below ours. By Jesus, I think they will blow up everything if we don’t improve our tactics.The duke of Gloucester, who has command over the siege, is in consultation with an Irishman, a very valiant gentleman indeed.It’s Captain Macmorris, right?I think so.Jesus, he’s an ass if there ever was one! I will say as much to his face. He knows no more about the proper practice of war, see—the ancient practices—than a puppy.Here he comes with Captain Jamy, the Scots captain.
