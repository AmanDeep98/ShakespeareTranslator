Thus with imagined wing our swift scene fliesIn motion of no less celerityThan that of thought. Suppose that you have seenThe well-appointed king at Hampton pierEmbark his royalty, and his brave fleetWith silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning.Play with your fancies and in them behold,Upon the hempen tackle, shipboys climbing.Hear the shrill whistle, which doth order giveTo sounds confused. Behold the threaden sails,Borne with th' invisible and creeping wind,Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea,Breasting the lofty surge.

Pretend that you’re standing on the shore, watching a city dance on the shifting waves, and you’ll have an idea of the look of this majestic fleet as it holds a straight course for Harfleur. Follow it, follow it! Hitch your minds to this navy’s sterns and leave your England, silent as midnight, guarded by grandfathers, babies, and old women. For what male subject is there old enough for his chin to be graced with even one hair who doesn’t want to follow this select band of hand-picked knights to France? Once there, make your thoughts work harder, and witness a siege. Take in the wheeled canons with their deadly gaping mouths trained on the walled city of Harfleur. Imagine the French ambassador returning to inform Harry that the king offers him
