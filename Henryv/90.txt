For there is none of you so mean and baseThat hath not noble luster in your eyes.I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,Straining upon the start. The game’s afoot.Follow your spirit, and upon this chargeCry “God for Harry, England, and Saint George!”#LBSFORGOLDon a leash, straining for the moment when you’ll be let loose. The hunt is on! Follow your spirit, and as you charge cry, “God for Harry, England, and Saint George!”
