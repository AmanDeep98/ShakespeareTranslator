On, on, on, on, on! To the breach, to the breach!Pray thee, corporal, stay. The knocks are too hot, and, for
mine own part, I have not a case of lives. The humor of it is
too hot; that is the very plainsong of it.
“The plainsong” is most just, for humors do abound.
(sings)
   Knocks go and come. God’s vassals drop and die,
   And sword and shield
   In bloody field
   Doth win immortal fame.
Would I were in an alehouse in London! I would give all my
fame for a pot of ale, and safety.
And I.
(sings)
   If wishes would prevail with me,
   My purpose should not fail with me,
   But thither would I hie.

(sings)
   As duly,
   But not as truly,
   As bird doth sing on bough.
Up to the breach, you dogs! Avaunt, you cullions!#LBSFORGOLDOn, on, on, on, on! To the breach, to the breach!Please, corporal, stop! The fighting is too violent. Speaking for myself, I only have one life, not dozens. Too violent! That’s just how it is, the plain truth of it.The plain truth doesn’t lie. You can see how it is all around. Fighting comes and goes, God’s loyal servants drop and die. (he sings)
   And sword and shield
   In bloody field
   Will win immortal fame.
I wish I were in an alehouse in London! I would give all my glory for a mug of ale and safety.Me too. (he sings)
   If wishes could avail me,
   My purpose would not fail me,
   It’s there that I would go.

(singing)
   As surely but more poorly
   Than birds sing on the bough.
Up to the breach, you dogs! Go! Get a move on, you scrotems!
