Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.Linger your patience on, and we’ll digestTh' abuse of distance, force a play.The sum is paid, the traitors are agreed,The king is set from London, and the sceneIs now transported, gentles, to Southampton.There is the playhouse now, there must you sit,And thence to France shall we convey you safeAnd bring you back, charming the narrow seasTo give you gentle pass; for, if we may,We’ll not offend one stomach with our play.But, till the king come forth, and not till then,Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.#LBSFORGOLDshifts, friends, to Southampton. That’s where you must pretend the theater is; that’s where you must sit. From there we’ll safely carry you to France and back, calming the waters of the Channel to provide you with a smooth voyage. For if we can help it, we’d just as soon nobody was made sick by our play. But we won’t shift the scene to Southampton until Henry reappears.
