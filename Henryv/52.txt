'Fore God, his grace is bold to trust these traitors.They shall be apprehended by and by.How smooth and even they do bear themselves,As if allegiance in their bosoms satCrownèd with faith and constant loyalty.The king hath note of all that they intend,By interception which they dream not of.Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,Whom he hath dulled and cloyed with gracious favors—That he should, for a foreign purse, so sellHis sovereign’s life to death and treachery!Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.—My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts.Think you not that the powers we bear with usWill cut their passage through the force of France,Doing the execution and the actFor which we have in head assembled them?No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.#LBSFORGOLDI must say, the king is taking a bold risk letting these traitors go free.They’ll be arrested in a little while.How smooth and cool they seem! Just as if they were perfectly loyal and faithful.The king has been informed of all their plans, but they have no idea.No, but it’s unbelievable that the man who was his dearest friend, a man he has showered with love and favor, would repay the king with treachery, selling his own sovereign’s life to a foreign power!Now that the wind is favorable, let’s board the ship.—My Lord of Cambridge and my good Lord of Masham and you, my noble knight, what do you think? Will our army cut a swath through the fighting force of France, achieving and accomplishing everything I’ve assembled them to do?No doubt it will, my liege, if each man does his best.
