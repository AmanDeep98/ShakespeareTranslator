So that by this intelligence we learnThe Welshmen are dispersed, and SalisburyIs gone to meet the king, who lately landedWith some few private friends upon this coast.The news is very fair and good, my lord:Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.It would beseem the Lord NorthumberlandTo say ‘King Richard:’ alack the heavy dayWhen such a sacred king should hide his head.Your grace mistakes; only to be briefLeft I his title out.The time hath been,Would you have been so brief with him, he wouldHave been so brief with you, to shorten you,For taking so the head, your whole head’s length.Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.Take not, good cousin, further than you should.Lest you mistake the heavens are o’er our heads.I know it, uncle, and oppose not myselfAgainst their will. But who comes here?#LBSFORGOLDSo we know from this latest news that the Welshmen have left the battlefield and that the king has landed with some of his friends on the coast, where Salisbury has gone to meet him. It’s good news, my lord. Richard is hiding not very far from here. It would be better for Lord Northumberland to call him “King Richard.” We should mourn the day that a king has to hide. Your grace misunderstands me. I only left off his title for the sake of brevity. There was a time when, if you’d been so brief in his presence, he would have made you even briefer, by chopping off your head. Uncle, don’t take this misunderstanding too far. Good cousin, don’t take more than you should, or you may forget heaven rules over us.I know it, uncle, and won’t oppose the will of heaven. But who is coming?
