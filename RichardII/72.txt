Think what you will, we seize into our handsHis plate, his goods, his money and his lands.I’ll not be by the while: my liege, farewell:What will ensue hereof, there’s none can tell;But by bad courses may be understoodThat their events can never fall out good.Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:Bid him repair to us to Ely HouseTo see this business. To-morrow nextWe will for Ireland; and ’tis time, I trow:And we create, in absence of ourself,Our uncle York lord governor of England;For he is just and always loved us well.Come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part;Be merry, for our time of stay is shortWell, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.And living too; for now his son is duke.Barely in title, not in revenue.Richly in both, if justice had her right.My heart is great; but it must break with silence,Ere’t be disburden’d with a liberal tongue.#LBSFORGOLDThink whatever you want, but we’re going to seize his money and all of his property.I won’t stand here and watch. Goodbye, my lord. What will happen now, nobody can say. But no good outcome can result from bad decisions like this.Bushy, go straight to the Earl of Wiltshire and tell him to come to Ely House to help us. Tomorrow morning we’ll go to Ireland. I believe it’s time. I’ll make my uncle York the Lord Governor of England while I’m away. He is fair and has always loved me very much. Come, my queen, we must leave tomorrow. Be well.Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.But he also kind of lives because his son is now a duke. His son might have the title of duke, but he doesn’t have the income of one.If there were justice in the world then he would both have the title and the income.I have a lot of troubles on my mind. But I must keep silent about them for now.
