Why, uncle, what’s the matter?O my liege,Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleasedNot to be pardon’d, am content withal.Seek you to seize and gripe into your handsThe royalties and rights of banish’d Hereford?Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?Did not the one deserve to have an heir?Is not his heir a well-deserving son?Take Hereford’s rights away, and take from TimeHis charters and his customary rights;Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;Be not thyself; for how art thou a kingBut by fair sequence and succession?Now, afore God—God forbid I say true!—If you do wrongfully seize Hereford’s rights,Call in the letters patent that he hathBy his attorneys-general to sueHis livery, and deny his offer’d homage,You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,You lose a thousand well-disposed heartsAnd prick my tender patience, to those thoughtsWhich honour and allegiance cannot think.#LBSFORGOLDWhy, uncle, what’s the matter?Oh, my lord, forgive me, please. If you won’t I’ll understand. Do you really want to seize all of Gaunt’s property? He might be dead, but isn’t his son still alive? Wasn’t Gaunt a good man, and isn’t Harry good, too? Doesn’t Gaunt deserve to have an heir? And isn’t Harry a deserving heir? If you take away Harry’s right to inherit his father’s belongings, then you are going against tradition. It would be like taking away Time’s authority and rights and preventing tomorrow from following today. Remember, you yourself are a king because you inherited the position. Now, I swear before God, if you do this, you will bring all sorts of danger to yourself and turn a thousand people against you. You will force me to lose my patience, and I’ll think about doing things to you that, because I still honor and obey you, I cannot even think about.
