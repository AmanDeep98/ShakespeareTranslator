Now God in heaven forbid!Ah, madam, ’tis too true: and that is worse,The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.Why have you not proclaim’d NorthumberlandAnd all the rest revolted faction traitors?We have: whereupon the Earl of WorcesterHath broke his staff, resign’d his stewardship,And all the household servants fled with himTo Bolingbroke.So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,And Bolingbroke my sorrow’s dismal heir:Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,And I, a gasping new-deliver’d mother,Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join’d.Despair not, madam.Who shall hinder me?I will despair, and be at enmityWith cozening hope: he is a flatterer,A parasite, a keeper back of death,Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,Which false hope lingers in extremity.#LBSFORGOLDGod, no!Madam, it’s true, and what’s worse is that Lord Northumberland, his young son Henry Percy, the Lord of Ross, the Lord of Beaumond, and the Lord of Willoughby, along with their powerful friends, have all gone to join him.Why haven’t you proclaimed Northumberland and the others traitors?We did, and that’s when the Earl of Worcester broke his staff, resigned his jobA staff is a rod of office and would have been carried by the Earl of Worcester, as the steward of the king’s household.staff, resigned his job, and, along with the king’s servants, fled to join Bolingbroke.So, Green, you have helped me to give birth: I was pregnant with sorrow, Bolingbroke is the newborn child, and I am like a gasping mother who has just delivered her baby.Madam, do not despair.Who’s going to stop me? I will despair, and I will not put up with any false hopes. False hope flatters and feeds on us, draws out our pain, and withholds death, which would be gentle otherwise.
