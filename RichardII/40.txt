No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,My name be blotted from the book of life,And I from heaven banish’d as from hence!But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;Save back to England, all the world’s my way.Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyesI see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspectHath from the number of his banish’d yearsPluck’d four away.Six frozen winter spent,Return with welcome home from banishment.How long a time lies in one little word!Four lagging winters and four wanton springsEnd in a word: such is the breath of kings.I thank my liege, that in regard of meHe shortens four years of my son’s exile:But little vantage shall I reap thereby;For, ere the six years that he hath to spendCan change their moons and bring their times aboutMy oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted lightShall be extinct with age and endless night;My inch of taper will be burnt and done,And blindfold death not let me see my son.#LBSFORGOLDNo, Bolingbroke. If I were ever a traitor, may I die and be forbidden from heaven! But you and I and God all know what you are, and I fear that the king will find out all too soon—to his sorrow. Goodbye, my lord. Now I’m unable to lose my way, since my way is anywhere in the world other than England. Uncle, I can see in your eyes how much you are grieving. Since you are so sad, I’ll reduce your son’s exile by four years. After six years, you will be welcome to come home. How much time is kept in a word! Four slow winters and four lush springs taken away in a word. That’s the power of a king. Thank you, my lord, for shortening my son’s exile for my sake. But I won’t gain much by it. By the time six years have passed I will be dead and won’t be able to see my son.
