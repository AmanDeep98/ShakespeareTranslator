Madam, your majesty is too much sad:You promised, when you parted with the king,To lay aside life-harming heavinessAnd entertain a cheerful disposition.To please the king I did; to please myselfI cannot do it; yet I know no causeWhy I should welcome such a guest as grief,Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guestAs my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune’s womb,Is coming towards me, and my inward soulWith nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,More than with parting from my lord the king.Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;For sorrow’s eye, glazed with blinding tears,Divides one thing entire to many objects;Like perspectives, which rightly gazed uponShow nothing but confusion, eyed awryDistinguish form: so your sweet majesty,Looking awry upon your lord’s departure,Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;Which, look’d on as it is, is nought but shadowsOf what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,More than your lord’s departure weep not: more’s not seen;Or if it be, ’tis with false sorrow’s eye,Which for things true weeps things imaginary.#LBSFORGOLDMadam, you are too sad. When we left the king, you promised to stop worrying so much and to try to act more cheerfully.I promised that to make the king happy, but for myself I cannot do it. I don’t know why I should be so sad, except that I had to say goodbye to my sweet Richard. But I also think that something bad is going to happen to me and I’m inwardly grieving. It’s making me more sad than the king’s leaving does.When you’re already sad it seems like everything is awful and your grief is multiplied. But, in reality, that’s not the case. Because you’re sad, things don’t appear to you as they actually are, so in your husband’s departure you see many things to grieve. Those are just shadows. So don’t cry for anything but your husband’s leaving. Any other causes of grief are just imaginary.
