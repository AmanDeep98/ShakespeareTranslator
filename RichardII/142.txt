My lord, in the base court he doth attendTo speak with you; may it please you to come down.Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,Wanting the manage of unruly jades.In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,To come at traitors’ calls and do them grace.In the base court? Come down? Down, court!down, king!For night-owls shriek where mounting larksshould sing.What says his majesty?Sorrow and grief of heartMakes him speak fondly, like a frantic manYet he is come.Stand all apart,And show fair duty to his majesty.My gracious lord,—Fair cousin, you debase your princely kneeTo make the base earth proud with kissing it:Me rather had my heart might feel your loveThan my unpleased eye see your courtesy.Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,Thus high at least, although your knee be low.#LBSFORGOLDMy lord, he waits in the outer court below to speak with you. Will you come down? I’m coming down, like shining PhaetonSon of Helios, the sun god, in Greek myth. Helios allowed him to drive the chariot of the sun, but Phaeton was unable to control the horses pulling the chariot. They veered too close to the earth, burning it, until Zeus struck Phaeton down with a thunderbolt.Phaeton unable to control unruly horses. In the bottom court? The bottom court, where kings become common enough to obey a traitor’s summons and bow to them. In the bottom court? Come down? The bottom court! And now the king is on the bottom! Everything is backward, and night owls shriek when mounting larks should be singing.What does the king say? His sorrow makes him speak foolishly, like a mad man. But he’s coming. Stand apart, and show your duty to the king. My gracious lord.Fair cousin, you insult your princely knee by touching it to the lowly earth. I’d rather my heart feel your love than my eyes see your fake courtesy. Get up, cousin. Your heart is proud, I know, even if your knee is humbled.
