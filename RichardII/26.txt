Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,Both who he is and why he cometh hitherThus plated in habiliments of war,And formally, according to our law,Depose him in the justice of his cause.What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither,Before King Richard in his royal lists?Against whom comest thou? and what’s thy quarrel?Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and DerbyAm I; who ready here do stand in arms,To prove, by God’s grace and my body’s valour,In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!On pain of death, no person be so boldOr daring-hardy as to touch the lists,Except the marshal and such officersAppointed to direct these fair designs.Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign’s hand,And bow my knee before his majesty:For Mowbray and myself are like two menThat vow a long and weary pilgrimage;Then let us take a ceremonious leaveAnd loving farewell of our several friends.#LBSFORGOLDMarshal, ask that knight who he is and why he is here armed for war. Make him formally testify as to the reason he is here to fight, as our law requires. What is your name, and why do you come here in front of King Richard? Who is your opponent? What is your quarrel? Speak like a true knight! I am Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby. I am ready to prove with my weapons, with God’s grace, and with my strength that Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, is a foul traitor, dangerous to King Richard and to me. May heaven defend me, since I fight for truth! Only the marshal and the appointed officials may direct the proceedings, and any other person foolish enough to enter the field will be put to death.Lord marshal, let me kiss the king’s hand and go on my knee before him. Mowbray and I are about to undertake a challenge similar to a long and difficult journey, so we should say a formal goodbye to our friends.
