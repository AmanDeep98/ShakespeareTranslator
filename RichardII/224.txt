Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.If thou love me, ’tis time thou wert away.What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.My lord, will’t please you to fall to?Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, wholately came from the king, commands the contrary.The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.Help, help, help!How now! what means death in this rude assault?Villain, thy own hand yields thy death’s instrument.Go thou, and fill another room in hell.That hand shall burn in never-quenching fireThat staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce handHath with the king’s blood stain’d the king’s own land.Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.#LBSFORGOLDFellow, go away. You can’t stay any longer. If you love me, you should go. I don’t dare say what my heart feels. My lord, will you eat? Taste it first, as you usually do. My lord, I don’t dare. Sir Pierce of Exton, who just arrived from the king, ordered me not to. May the devil take Henry of Lancaster and you! I am tired of being patient. Help, help, help! Do you mean to kill me in this despicable assault? Villain, I’ll kill you with your own weapon. Go to hell. You’ll burn in hell forever for killing me. Exton, you’ve stained the king’s land with the king’s own blood. Arise my soul! Your place is in heaven, while my body sinks down and dies.
