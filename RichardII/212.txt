Good aunt, stand up.Nay, do not say, ‘stand up;’Say, ‘pardon’ first, and afterwards ‘stand up.’And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,‘Pardon’ should be the first word of thy speech.I never long’d to hear a word till now;Say ‘pardon,’ king; let pity teach thee how:The word is short, but not so short as sweet;No word like ‘pardon’ for kings’ mouths so meet.Speak it in French, king; say, ‘pardonne moi.’Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,That set’st the word itself against the word!Speak ‘pardon’ as ’tis current in our land;The chopping French we do not understand.Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,Pity may move thee ‘pardon’ to rehearse.Good aunt, stand up.I do not sue to stand;Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.#LBSFORGOLDGood aunt, stand up. No, don’t say, “Stand up.” First say, “I forgive,” and then you can tell me to stand up. If I were your nanny, the first word I would teach you would be “pardon.” I’ve never wanted to hear a word so badly. Say “pardon,” king. Let pity teach you how. The word is short and sweeter than it is short. It’s the most fitting word for a king to say. Say it in French, king. Say, “Pardonne moi.”Excuse me.”“Pardonne moi.” Do you try to destroy forgiveness by teaching that pardon? Oh, my sour husband, my hardhearted lord, you’d make that word the opposite of what it means. Say “pardon” in English. We don’t understand French. I can see it in your eyes, so let your tongue say it. Listen to the pity in your heart with your ears, which our laments and prayers pierce, so that pity may move you to say “pardon.” Good aunt, stand up. I’m not begging to stand. All I want is a pardon.I pardon him, as God will one day pardon me.
