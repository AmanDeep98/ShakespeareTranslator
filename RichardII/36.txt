Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:The sly slow hours shall not determinateThe dateless limit of thy dear exile;The hopeless word of ‘never to return’Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,And all unlook’d for from your highness’ mouth:A dearer merit, not so deep a maimAs to be cast forth in the common air,Have I deserved at your highness’ hands.The language I have learn’d these forty years,My native English, now I must forego:And now my tongue’s use is to me no moreThan an unstringed viol or a harp,Or like a cunning instrument cased up,Or, being open, put into his handsThat knows no touch to tune the harmony:Within my mouth you have engaol’d my tongue,Doubly portcullis’d with my teeth and lips;And dull unfeeling barren ignoranceIs made my gaoler to attend on me.I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,Too far in years to be a pupil now:What is thy sentence then but speechless death,Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?#LBSFORGOLDNorfolk, I reluctantly must give you a harsher sentence. Your absence won’t be marked by a certain number of hours. I must banish you for life. It’s a heavy sentence, my lord, and I didn’t expect to hear you say that. I deserved to be rewarded, not punished so harshly with exile. I’ll have to abandon my native English language, which I’ve spoken for forty years. My tongue will be of as little use as a broken violin. You’ve imprisoned it, and ignorance will be my jailer. I’m too old to learn anything new. You’ve sentenced me to die in silence.
