Whatever God or fate has in store for me, I will live or die as a loyal, just, and honest gentleman. I joyfully celebrate this battle against my enemy, as much as any slave celebrates who takes off his chains and becomes free. Most powerful king and my friends, I wish you all happiness in the years to come. I go to fight as happily as I would join in a celebration, because knowing that I have truth on my side makes me feel calm. Goodbye, my lord. I see both virtue and courage in you. Marshal, let’s begin. Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby, take your lance. May God defend the right man!
