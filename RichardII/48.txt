Come, come, my son, I’ll bring thee on thy way:Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.Then, England’s ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!Where’er I wander, boast of this I can,Though banish’d, yet a trueborn Englishman.#LBSFORGOLDCome, come, my son, I’ll put you on your way. If I were young enough, I wouldn’t remain here. Then goodbye, England’s earth. Goodbye, sweet soil, my motherland. Wherever I go, I can boast that I am a true Englishman, even if I am banished.
