The noble duke hath been too much abused.It stands your grace upon to do him right.Base men by his endowments are made great.My lords of England, let me tell you this:I have had feeling of my cousin’s wrongsAnd laboured all I could to do him right;But in this kind to come, in braving arms,Be his own carver and cut out his way,To find out right with wrong, it may not be;And you that do abet him in this kindCherish rebellion and are rebels all.The noble duke hath sworn his coming isBut for his own; and for the right of thatWe all have strongly sworn to give him aid;And let him ne’er see joy that breaks that oath!Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,Because my power is weak and all ill left:But if I could, by Him that gave me life,I would attach you all and make you stoopUnto the sovereign mercy of the king;But since I cannot, be it known to youI do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;Unless you please to enter in the castleAnd there repose you for this night.#LBSFORGOLDThe noble duke has been abused very much.You owe it to him to treat him well.His money and property are making lowly men rich.Listen, lords of England: I’ve known about the injustices done to my cousin, and I have done everything I could to correct them. But because of the way he’s returned to England, with an army and all these weapons, there’s nothing I can do. And you who are helping him are just lowly rebels.The noble duke has sworn he has come back to England only for his own sake and not for any other reason. We have all sworn to help him, and I hope anyone who breaks that promise never feels joy again.Well, well, I see how this is going to go. I admit I can’t change it, because my army is weak. But if God would let me, I’d arrest you all and make you stoop down before our king. But since I can’t, I’m going to remain neutral. So, good luck to you. Or do you want to come sleep in the castle tonight?
