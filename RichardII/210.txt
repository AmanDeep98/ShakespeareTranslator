Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.Rise up, good aunt.Not yet, I thee beseech:For ever will I walk upon my knees,And never see day that the happy sees,Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.Unto my mother’s prayers I bend my knee.Against them both my true joints bended be.Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:He prays but faintly and would be denied;We pray with heart and soul and all beside:His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them haveThat mercy which true prayer ought to have.#LBSFORGOLDYou crazy woman, what are you doing here? Are you going to nurse another traitor with your old breasts? Sweet York, be patient. Gentle king, listen to me. Get up, good aunt. Not yet, I beg you. I’ll stay on my knees and never look up again until you give me joy by forgiving Rutland, my wayward son. I’ll kneel, too, in support of my mother’s prayers. I’ll kneel to oppose them. If you forgive him, you’ll only nurture more bad deeds. Is he serious? Look at his face. He’s not crying. His prayers are a joke. His words come from his mouth, but ours come from our hearts. He prays softly, hoping to be denied. We pray with heart and soul and all our bodies. I know his old and tired knees would like to straighten up. We’ll stay kneeling till our knees grow roots in the ground. His prayers are hypocritical, while ours are full of true desire and integrity. Our prayers are more prayer-like than his, so let our prayers be rewarded as they ought to be, with mercy.
