Thou hast said enough.Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forthOf that sweet way I was in to despair!What say you now? what comfort have we now?By heaven, I’ll hate him everlastinglyThat bids me be of comfort any more.Go to Flint castle: there I’ll pine away;A king, woe’s slave, shall kingly woe obey.That power I have, discharge; and let them goTo ear the land that hath some hope to grow,For I have none: let no man speak againTo alter this, for counsel is but vain.My liege, one word.He does me double wrongThat wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.Discharge my followers: let them hence away,From Richard’s night to Bolingbroke’s fair day.#LBSFORGOLDYou have said enough.I curse you, cousin, for convincing me not to be sad anymore. What do you have to say now? What comforts us now? I swear to God, I will forever hate the man who tells me not to despair now. Go to Flint Castle. That’s where I will wait. I am a king, but I am a slave of sorrow, and I will follow sorrow’s orders. Tell my army that they may leave and go work for some cause that has hope, since I have none. I don’t want to hear anyone trying to change my mind. Any advice is pointless.My lord, may I have a word.The person who tries to convince me again not to despair will become the second person to treat me poorly. Let my army go. England will be Bolingbroke’s very soon.
