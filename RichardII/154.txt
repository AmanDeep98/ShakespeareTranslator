Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,I would my skill were subject to thy curse.Here did she fall a tear; here in this placeI’ll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,In the remembrance of a weeping queen.#LBSFORGOLDPoor queen! I wish her curse would strike my skill if it would help her. Her tear fell right here. I’ll plant rue there, since it is a bitter and sad herb. If only out of pity, rue will soon grow here in remembrance of a weeping queen.
