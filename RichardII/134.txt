Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?The castle royally is mann’d, my lord,Against thy entrance.Royally!Why, it contains no king?Yes, my good lord,It doth contain a king; King Richard liesWithin the limits of yon lime and stone:And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergymanOf holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.Noble lords,Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parleyInto his ruin’d ears, and thus deliver:Henry BolingbrokeOn both his knees doth kiss King Richard’s handAnd sends allegiance and true faith of heartTo his most royal person, hither comeEven at his feet to lay my arms and power,Provided that my banishment repeal’dAnd lands restored again be freely granted:If not, I’ll use the advantage of my powerAnd lay the summer’s dust with showers of bloodRain’d from the wounds of slaughter’d Englishmen:The which, how far off from the mind of BolingbrokeIt is, such crimson tempest should bedrenchThe fresh green lap of fair King Richard’s land,My stooping duty tenderly shall show.Go, signify as much, while here we marchUpon the grassy carpet of this plain.Let’s march without the noise of threatening drum,That from this castle’s tatter’d battlementsOur fair appointments may be well perused.Methinks King Richard and myself should meetWith no less terror than the elementsOf fire and water, when their thundering shockAt meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.Be he the fire, I’ll be the yielding water:The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rainMy waters; on the earth, and not on him.March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.#LBSFORGOLDWelcome, Harry. What, won’t this castle give in? The castle is guarded by royal soldiers, my lord, and they won’t let you enter. Royal! But there’s no king here, is there? Yes, my lord, there is a king here. King Richard is inside, along with Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury, Sir Stephen Scroop, as well a holy clergyman whom I don’t know.It’s probably the Bishop of Carlisle. Noble lords, approach the crude walls of this old castle and let the trumpets sound a signal to the king that we want to meet. Deliver this message: Henry Bolingbroke kneels before King Richard, kisses his hand, and offers his loyalty and true faith of heart. I come to lay my weapons and my power at his feet, as long as he repeals my banishment and freely gives back all my lands. If he won’t, I’ll use my power to rain his Englishmen’s blood on the summer’s dust. By kneeling submissively before him I’ll show how little I desire to drench his green lands in this way. Go, tell him, and meanwhile we’ll march here on the plain. Let’s march without the drums so that they can clearly see our excellent military equipment from the castle’s ruined roof. I think King Richard and I should meet in the same way that lightning and rain mix in the sky, producing thunder that rips it apart. If he’s the lightning, I’ll be the rain. He can rage, while I will yield and pour my waters on the earth. But only on the earth, not on him. March along, and notice how King Richard looks.
