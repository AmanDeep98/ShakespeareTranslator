The appellant in all duty greets your highness,And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.We will descend and fold him in our arms.Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,So be thy fortune in this royal fight!Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.O let no noble eye profane a tearFor me, if I be gored with Mowbray’s spear:As confident as is the falcon’s flightAgainst a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.My loving lord, I take my leave of you;Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;Not sick, although I have to do with death,But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreetThe daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:O thou, the earthly author of my blood,Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,Doth with a twofold vigour lift me upTo reach at victory above my head,Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;And with thy blessings steel my lance’s point,That it may enter Mowbray’s waxen coat,And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,Even in the lusty havior of his son.#LBSFORGOLDThe accuser greets your highness and asks to kiss your hand and say goodbye.  I’ll step down and embrace him. Cousin of Hereford, insofar as your cause is just, I wish you luck in this fight. Goodbye, my cousin. If you die in this fight, I will grieve, but I won’t take revenge. If I am pierced by Mowbray’s lance, don’t misuse your tears for me. I’m as confident as the hawk is when he hunts the sparrow. My loving king, goodbye, and goodbye my cousin, Lord Aumerle. I’m healthy, young, and alive now, even if I’m close to death. Lastly, I’ll say farewell to you, my father, just as at a feast I save the best morsel for the end. Oh my creator, your youthful spirit is reborn in me and energizes me to reach for victory. Give strength to my armor with your prayers, and harden my lance with your blessing, so it will pierce Mowbray’s coat of armor. May my brave deeds bring new honor to the name of John of Gaunt.
