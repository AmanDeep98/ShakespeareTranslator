My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,When weeping made you break the story off,of our two cousins coming into London.Where did I leave?At that sad stop, my lord,Where rude misgovern’d hands from windows’ topsThrew dust and rubbish on King Richard’s head.Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,Mounted upon a hot and fiery steedWhich his aspiring rider seem’d to know,With slow but stately pace kept on his course,Whilst all tongues cried ‘God save thee,Bolingbroke!’You would have thought the very windows spake,So many greedy looks of young and oldThrough casements darted their desiring eyesUpon his visage, and that all the wallsWith painted imagery had said at once‘Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!’Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed’s neck,Bespake them thus: ‘I thank you, countrymen:’And thus still doing, thus he pass’d along.#LBSFORGOLDMy lord, you told me you would tell the rest of the story about our two relatives coming to London, until weeping made you stop. Where did I stop the story? At the sad place, my lord, when rude hands were throwing dust and rubbish on King Richard’s head from the upper windows. Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke, got on a magnificent horse that seemed to know it was him and kept going in a slow and stately way. All around, people were calling, “God save you, Bolingbroke!” You would have thought the windows themselves were talking. Both old and young people were looking out on him with happy desire, and on the painted walls all around was written, “Jesus protect you! Welcome, Bolingbroke!” Meanwhile, he was turning his head, bare of any helmet and not even as tall as his horse’s neck, and said, “I thank you, countrymen.” And he continued along saying this as he went.
