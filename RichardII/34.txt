Draw near,And list what with our council we have done.For that our kingdom’s earth should not be soil’dWith that dear blood which it hath fostered;And for our eyes do hate the dire aspectOf civil wounds plough’d up with neighbours’ sword;And for we think the eagle-winged prideOf sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,With rival-hating envy, set on youTo wake our peace, which in our country’s cradleDraws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,With harsh resounding trumpets’ dreadful bray,And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,Might from our quiet confines fright fair peaceAnd make us wade even in our kindred’s blood,Therefore, we banish you our territories:You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,Till twice five summers have enrich’d our fieldsShall not regreet our fair dominions,But tread the stranger paths of banishment.Your will be done: this must my comfort be,Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;And those his golden beams to you here lentShall point on me and gild my banishment.#LBSFORGOLDDraw near, and listen to what I have devised with my council. Our kingdom, where you both grew up, should not be soiled with your blood, and I hate the spectacle of settling such quarrels with swords. I think that pride, ambition, and envy have caused you to disturb the sweet peace of this country. Once that peace is broken by war drums and the clash of weapons, relatives will be killing each other. Therefore, I’m sending you out into distant territories. You, my cousin Hereford, at the threat of execution if you return, are banished for ten years. I will do as you command. My comfort in my banishment will be the thought that the same sun that shines on you will shine on me wherever I am.
