Name it, fair cousin.‘Fair cousin’? I am greater than a king:For when I was a king, my flatterersWere then but subjects; being now a subject,I have a king here to my flatterer.Being so great, I have no need to beg.Yet ask.And shall I have?You shall.Then give me leave to go.Whither?Whither you will, so I were from your sights.Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.O, good! convey? conveyers are you all,That rise thus nimbly by a true king’s fall.On Wednesday next we solemnly set downOur coronation: lords, prepare yourselves.A woeful pageant have we here beheld.The woe’s to come; the children yet unborn.Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.You holy clergymen, is there no plotTo rid the realm of this pernicious blot?#LBSFORGOLDWhatever you want, fair cousin. “Fair cousin”? I must be mightier than a king, since when I was a king subjects flattered me, but now that I’m a subject the king flatters me. Since I’m so mighty, I don’t need to beg. Ask anyway. And will I have it? You will. Then give me permission to go. Where? Wherever you want, as long as it is away from you. Go, some of you take him to the tower. Oh good! Take me? You’re all takers who’ve risen so mightily by my downfall. Next Wednesday, I’ll be crowned. Lords, prepare for it. This is a sad scene we’ve witnessed. The sadness is yet to come. Children who aren’t even born yet will feel the effects of this day like a thorn in their side. You holy men, isn’t there a way we can get rid of this terrible ruler?
