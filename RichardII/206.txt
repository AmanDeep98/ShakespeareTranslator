[Within] Open the door, secure, foolhardy king:Shall I for love speak treason to thy face?Open the door, or I will break it open.What is the matter, uncle? speak;Recover breath; tell us how near is danger,That we may arm us to encounter it.Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt knowThe treason that my haste forbids me show.Remember, as thou read’st, thy promise pass’d:I do repent me; read not my name thereMy heart is not confederate with my hand.It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.I tore it from the traitor’s bosom, king;Fear, and not love, begets his penitence:Forget to pity him, lest thy pity proveA serpent that will sting thee to the heart.O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!O loyal father of a treacherous son!Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,From when this stream through muddy passagesHath held his current and defiled himself!Thy overflow of good converts to bad,And thy abundant goodness shall excuseThis deadly blot in thy digressing son.#LBSFORGOLD(speaking from off-stage) Open the door, my foolish king. Should I harshly criticize you out of love for you? Open the door, or I’ll break it down. What is the matter, uncle? Tell me. Catch your breath. Tell me how close the danger is so that I can prepare for it. Read this, and you’ll know what treason made me hurry so fast that I can hardly speak. Remember, as you read, what you just promised. I already regret it. Don’t read my name there. My heart doesn’t match what my hand wrote. Villain, your heart believed it before your hand wrote it. I took the paper from the traitor, king. He regrets it out of fear, not out of love for you. Don’t pity him, because that pity will come back to harm you. Oh, what a terrible and bold conspiracy! Oh, loyal father of a treacherous son! Your pure goodness overwhelms the wrongdoing of your foul son. Because you have proven yourself so loyal, I’ll forgive your son’s damnable crime.
