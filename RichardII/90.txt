The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,But none returns. For us to levy powerProportionable to the enemyIs all unpossible.Besides, our nearness to the king in loveIs near the hate of those love not the king.And that’s the wavering commons: for their loveLies in their purses, and whoso empties themBy so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.Wherein the king stands generally condemn’d.If judgement lie in them, then so do we,Because we ever have been near the king.Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.Thither will I with you; for little officeThe hateful commons will perform for us,Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.Will you go along with us?No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.Farewell: if heart’s presages be not vain,We three here art that ne’er shall meet again.That’s as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.#LBSFORGOLDThe message has probably reached Ireland, but no news has come back yet. It’s impossible for us to find enough soldiers to match the enemy’s force.Besides, our closeness to the king means we are hated by those who hate the king.And that’s how the common folk must be. Their love depends on who gives them money, and they hate those who take their money away.That’s why almost all the common folk hate the king.If they’re to be the judges, then our fate is in their hands, because we’ve always been on the side of the king.Well, I’m going straight to Bristol Castle to take refuge. The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.I’ll go with you. The hateful common folk won’t help us at all but will act like dogs and tear us to pieces. Will you come with us?No. I’ll go to the king in Ireland. Goodbye. If my instinct is correct, the three of us here will never meet again.That depends on whether York can defeat Bolingbroke.
