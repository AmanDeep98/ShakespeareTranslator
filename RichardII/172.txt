No more, but that you readThese accusations and these grievous crimesCommitted by your person and your followersAgainst the state and profit of this land;That, by confessing them, the souls of menMay deem that you are worthily deposed.Must I do so? and must I ravel outMy weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,If thy offences were upon record,Would it not shame thee in so fair a troopTo read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,There shouldst thou find one heinous article,Containing the deposing of a kingAnd cracking the strong warrant of an oath,Mark’d with a blot, damn’d in the book of heaven:Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,Though some of you with Pilate wash your handsShowing an outward pity; yet you PilatesHave here deliver’d me to my sour cross,And water cannot wash away your sin.My lord, dispatch; read o’er these articles.Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:And yet salt water blinds them not so muchBut they can see a sort of traitors here.Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,I find myself a traitor with the rest;For I have given here my soul’s consentTo undeck the pompous body of a king;Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.#LBSFORGOLDNothing but for you to read aloud all the accusations and crimes that you and your followers committed against the wellbeing and prosperity of this country. Once you’ve confessed, everyone can agree that you’ve been justly dethroned. Do I have to? Do I have to list out these charges? Dear Northumberland, if all your crimes were listed out, wouldn’t you be ashamed to read them in front of such a distinguished group? If you did, you’d find on the list the terrible crime of deposing a king and breaking an oath, crimes condemned by heaven. All of you who are watching me act out my miserable fate here pretend like PilateThe Roman governor of Judea who ordered the crucifixion of Jesus. He washed his hands to signify that the execution took place at the request of the Jews and he took no responsibility.Pilate that you’ve done nothing wrong and look at me with pity. But you’ve all played a part in bringing me to this state, and you can’t deny your sin. My lord, get on with it. Read the charges. My eyes are full of tears and I can’t see. But even so, I can see a group of traitors in front of me. And if I look at myself, I see just as great a traitor. I’ve agreed to give up my royal garments, made nobility common, and made a master a slave. I’ve made a king a subject and made the richest the poorest.
