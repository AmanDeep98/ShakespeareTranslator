My lord,—No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,Nor no man’s lord; I have no name, no title,No, not that name was given me at the font,But ’tis usurp’d: alack the heavy day,That I have worn so many winters out,And know not now what name to call myself!O that I were a mockery king of snow,Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,To melt myself away in water-drops!Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,An if my word be sterling yet in England,Let it command a mirror hither straight,That it may show me what a face I have,Since it is bankrupt of his majesty.Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.Read o’er this paper while the glass doth come.Fiend, thou torment’st me ere I come to hell!Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.The commons will not then be satisfied.They shall be satisfied: I’ll read enough,When I do see the very book indeedWhere all my sins are writ, and that’s myself.#LBSFORGOLDMy lord— I’m not your lord, you haughty, insulting man. I’m no man’s lord. I don’t have a name or a title. The name I was baptized with is no longer mine. How sad it is that I am so old and I don’t know what to call myself! If only I were a snowman, I could stand in front of the sun of Bolingbroke and let myself be melted! Good king, great king, but not a very good man. If my commands still have value in England, let me command someone to bring me a mirror, so I may see what I look like without any of my noble majesty. Someone go and get a mirror.Read this paper until the mirror arrives. Fiend, you are torturing me before I even get to hell! Lord Northumberland, stop asking him to read it. The House of Commons won’t be satisfied. They’ll get what they want. I’ll read it when I can look at my face and see the sins that appear there.
