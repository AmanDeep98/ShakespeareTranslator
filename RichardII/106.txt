An offer, uncle, that we will accept:But we must win your grace to go with usTo Bristol castle, which they say is heldBy Bushy, Bagot and their complices,The caterpillars of the commonwealth,Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.It may be I will go with you: but yet I’ll pause;For I am loath to break our country’s laws.Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:Things past redress are now with me past care.#LBSFORGOLDYes, uncle, we do. But first we must convince you to go with us to Bristol Castle, which I’ve heard is being held by Bushy, Bagot, and their accomplices. They are devouring the kingdom like caterpillars, and I’ve sworn to eliminate them.I might go with you, but let me think about it first. I hate to break our country’s laws. I look at you neither as a friend nor a foe, and I don’t care about people’s past misdeeds that can’t be fixed now.
