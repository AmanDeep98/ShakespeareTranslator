O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;Twice saying ‘pardon’ doth not pardon twain,But makes one pardon strong.With all my heartI pardon him.A god on earth thou art.But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,With all the rest of that consorted crew,Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.Good uncle, help to order several powersTo Oxford, or where’er these traitors are:They shall not live within this world, I swear,But I will have them, if I once know where.Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:Your mother well hath pray’d, and prove you true.Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new.#LBSFORGOLDOh, the happy view from a bended knee! But I’m still fearful. Say it again. Saying it twice doesn’t divide your pardon and weaken it but makes the one pardon stronger. With all my heart, I pardon him. You are a god on earth. But my trusted brother-in-law, the abbot, and all the rest of that group of conspirators must be destroyed. Good uncle, send several men to Oxford or wherever these traitors are hiding. I swear that as long as they are alive, I will find them and capture them. Uncle, goodbye, and goodbye cousin, too. Your mother has prayed well and proved your loyalty. Come, my son. I’ll pray that God forces you to reform.
