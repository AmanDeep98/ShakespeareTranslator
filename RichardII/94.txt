How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?Believe me, noble lord,I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:These high wild hills and rough uneven waysDraws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,Making the hard way sweet and delectable.But I bethink me what a weary wayFrom Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be foundIn Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,Which, I protest, hath very much beguiledThe tediousness and process of my travel:But theirs is sweetened with the hope to haveThe present benefit which I possess;And hope to joy is little less in joyThan hope enjoy’d: by this the weary lordsShall make their way seem short, as mine hath doneBy sight of what I have, your noble company.Of much less value is my companyThan your good words. But who comes here?#LBSFORGOLDHow much farther is it to Berkeley, my lord?Believe me, my noble lord, I’m a stranger to these parts. These high and wild hills go on for miles and are tiring. And yet your good conversation has been like sugar, making the difficult journey sweeter. But I think it will be a long and hard journey from Ravenspurgh to Cotswold for Ross and Willoughby since they won’t have your company, which has made my trip easier. But their trip will be made more enjoyable by the expectation that you’ll go with them next time. In this way, the journey for those tired lords will seem shorter. That’s what has happened to me. My journey has seemed shorter because you’ve been with me.My companionship isn’t nearly as valuable as your kind words. Who’s coming?
