Since I have no happiness, happy stories only remind me of sorrow. Since I am full of grief, sad stories only add more sorrow to my lack of happiness. I don’t need to add on to what I already have, and it does no good to complain about what I want. Madam, I’ll sing. It’s wonderful that you are happy enough to sing, but it would make me happier if you wept.
