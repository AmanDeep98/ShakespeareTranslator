Are you contented to resign the crown?Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.Now mark me, how I will undo myself;I give this heavy weight from off my headAnd this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;With mine own tears I wash away my balm,With mine own hands I give away my crown,With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,With mine own breath release all duty’s rites:All pomp and majesty I do forswear;My manors, rents, revenues I forego;My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!Long mayst thou live in Richard’s seat to sit,And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!God save King Harry, unking’d Richard says,And send him many years of sunshine days!What more remains?#LBSFORGOLDAre you willing to give up the crown? Yes and no. No and yes, since I must not be anything. So, no, no, because I give it up to you. Now look, I’ll make myself nothing. I’ll give you this heavy crown from my head, and this scepter from my hand. I’ll take the pride of being king out of my heart. My own tears will wash away the oil that made me king. My own hands will give away the crown. My own tongue will deny my sacred right to be king. My own breath will give up all oaths of allegiance made to me. I give up all the ritual and ceremony, all my homes, my income, and reject all the laws I enacted. May God pardon everyone who breaks his oath to me! May God keep them from breaking their oath to you! Let me grieve for nothing since I have nothing, and let you be pleased with everything since you have everything! May you live long in my place, and let me be buried soon! God save King Harry, former King Richard says, and let him have many happy days! What else is left?
