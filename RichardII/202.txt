Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?’Tis full three months since I did see him last;If any plague hang over us, ’tis he.I would to God, my lords, he might be found:Inquire at London, ’mongst the taverns there,For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,With unrestrained loose companions,Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,Takes on the point of honour to supportSo dissolute a crew.My lord, some two days since I saw the prince,And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.And what said the gallant?His answer was, he would unto the stews,And from the common’st creature pluck a glove,And wear it as a favour; and with thatHe would unhorse the lustiest challenger.As dissolute as desperate; yet through bothI see some sparks of better hope, which elder yearsMay happily bring forth. But who comes here?#LBSFORGOLDCan’t anyone tell me about my irresponsible son? It’s been three months since I last saw him. He’s the only trouble in my life. I want him found. Ask in London, around the bars there. They say he goes to them every day with immoral friends, the kind of people who ambush passersby in the street and beat and rob the guards. My pleasure-seeking son thinks it’s a badge of honor to support such an awful crowd. My lord, two days ago I saw the prince and told him about the celebration at Oxford. And what did he say? He said that he would go to the whorehouse and get a glove from the most promiscuous whore there to wear as a favor. And then he would win in the jousts. Even if he is immoral and reckless, I still see some hope that his better qualities will emerge as he gets older. But who is approaching?
