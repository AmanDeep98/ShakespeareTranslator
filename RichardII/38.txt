It boots thee not to be compassionate:After our sentence plaining comes too late.Then thus I turn me from my country’s light,To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.Return again, and take an oath with thee.Lay on our royal sword your banish’d hands;Swear by the duty that you owe to God—Our part therein we banish with yourselves—To keep the oath that we administer:You never shall, so help you truth and God!Embrace each other’s love in banishment;Nor never look upon each other’s face;Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcileThis louring tempest of your home-bred hate;Nor never by advised purpose meetTo plot, contrive, or complot any ill’Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.I swear.And I, to keep all this.Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:—By this time, had the king permitted us,One of our souls had wander’d in the air.Banish’d this frail sepulchre of our flesh,As now our flesh is banish’d from this land:Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;Since thou hast far to go, bear not alongThe clogging burthen of a guilty soul.#LBSFORGOLDIt doesn’t help to despair, and once my sentence is handed out it is too late to lament. Then I’ll turn away from the light of this country and resign myself to darkness. Come back, and take an oath. Put your hands on my sword and swear this by your duty to God—since your duty to me will end with your banishment—that you will never greet each other in exile, or write to each other, or make up with each other, and that you won’t plot any foul deed against me, my country, my subjects, or any of my land. I swear. So do I. If the king had allowed us to fight, Norfolk my enemy, one of us would be dead by now. One of our souls would have been banished from its body, just as our bodies are now banished from this country. Confess your treason before you go. Don’t take the cumbersome burden of those sins with you.
