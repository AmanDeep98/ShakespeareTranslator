It is my son, young Harry Percy,Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.Harry, how fares your uncle?I had thought, my lord, to have learn’d his health of you.Why, is he not with the queen?No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,Broken his staff of office and dispersedThe household of the king.What was his reason?He was not so resolved when last we spake together.Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,And sent me over by Berkeley, to discoverWhat power the Duke of York had levied there;Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?No, my good lord, for that is not forgotWhich ne’er I did remember: to my knowledge,I never in my life did look on him.Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.My gracious lord, I tender you my service,Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:Which elder days shall ripen and confirmTo more approved service and desert.#LBSFORGOLDIt’s my son, young Harry Percy. He was sent by my brother Worcester, wherever he may be. Harry, how is your uncle Worcester?I was thinking, my lord, that you would tell me that.Is he not with the queen?No, my good lord. He has abandoned the court. He broke his staff and let the king’s servants go.What was his reason? The last time we were together he hadn’t decided to do that.He did it because you were proclaimed a traitor. But, my lord, he’s gone now to Ravenspurgh, to help the Duke of Hereford, and he sent me to Berkeley to discover how large an army the Duke of York had there. Then he gave me orders to go on to Ravenspurgh. Have you forgotten who the Duke of Hereford is, boy?No, my good lord, because I can’t forget something I never remembered. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him in my life.Then meet him now. This is the duke.My gracious lord, I am in your service. I am young, but as I get older, I will demonstrate more impressive abilities.
