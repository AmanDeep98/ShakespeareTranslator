Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?As in a theatre, the eyes of men,After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,Are idly bent on him that enters next,Thinking his prattle to be tedious;Even so, or with much more contempt, men’s eyesDid scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried ‘God save him!’No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,His face still combating with tears and smiles,The badges of his grief and patience,That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel’dThe hearts of men, they must perforce have meltedAnd barbarism itself have pitied him.But heaven hath a hand in these events,To whose high will we bound our calm contents.To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,Whose state and honour I for aye allow.Here comes my son Aumerle.Aumerle that was;But that is lost for being Richard’s friend,And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:I am in parliament pledge for his truthAnd lasting fealty to the new-made king.#LBSFORGOLDAlas, poor Richard? Where was he riding then? People looked at him with the dissatisfaction they might have for a supporting actor who comes on stage after the star has left. They stared at him with contempt, and no one cried out, “God save him!” No one welcomed him back. Instead, they threw dust on his sacred head. He shook it off with gentle sorrow, while he both cried and smiled as he wrestled with grief and patience. For some reason God must have hardened everyone’s hearts, otherwise they would have melted so that even a barbarian would have pitied him. But heaven has ordered all this, and we must follow its will. We are Bolingbroke’s subjects now, and I must forever acknowledge his rule and honor. Here comes my son Aumerle. He was Duke of Aumerle, but because he was Richard’s friend, he has lost his title. You must call him RutlandHe retains the title of Earl of Rutland.Rutland now. I’ve sworn in Parliament that he will honor and obey our new king.
