And let them die that age and sullens have;For both hast thou, and both become the grave.I do beseech your majesty, impute his wordsTo wayward sickliness and age in him:He loves you, on my life, and holds you dearAs Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.Right, you say true: as Hereford’s love, so his;As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty.What says he?Nay, nothing; all is saidHis tongue is now a stringless instrument;Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent.Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,Which live like venom where no venom elseBut only they have privilege to live.And for these great affairs do ask some charge,Towards our assistance we do seize to usThe plate, corn, revenues and moveables,Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess’d.#LBSFORGOLDAnd let those who are old and gloomy die, and you, John of Gaunt, are both.I beg you, your majesty, blame his words on his age and his sickness. I swear that he loves you and holds you as close to his heart as he does Harry Duke of Hereford.Right, what you say is true. Just as Harry holds me close to his heart, John of Gaunt must hold me also. And, in turn, I love both of them. That’s how it is.My lord, Gaunt sends his regards to you. What did he say?Actually, he didn’t say anything. He can’t talk. He has died.I hope that I will be the next to die! Death is terrible, but at least it stops the pain of living.Gaunt is the first to die, just like the ripest fruit is always the first to fall off the tree. Well, that’s over with. Now, about the war in Ireland. We must get rid of those shaggy-haired Irish soldiers who live there. Let’s seize all of Gaunt’s money and property to help pay for the war.
