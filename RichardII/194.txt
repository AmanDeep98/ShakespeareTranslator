Welcome, my son: who are the violets nowThat strew the green lap of the new come spring?Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:God knows I had as lief be none as one.Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,Lest you be cropp’d before you come to prime.What news from Oxford? hold those jousts and triumphs?For aught I know, my lord, they do.You will be there, I know.If God prevent not, I purpose so.What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?Yea, look’st thou pale? let me see the writing.My lord, ’tis nothing.No matter, then, who see it;I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.I do beseech your grace to pardon me:It is a matter of small consequence,Which for some reasons I would not have seen.Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.I fear, I fear,—What should you fear?’Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter’d intoFor gay apparel ’gainst the triumph day.#LBSFORGOLDWelcome, my son. Who are the new favorites of the king?Madam, I don’t know and I don’t care. God knows I prefer just as much not to be one. Well, hold yourself upright in this new regime, or you’ll die before your time. What’s the news from Oxford? Are the jousts and festivities happening?For all I know they are. You will be there, I know. I mean to, unless God prevents it. What is the note that I see in your shirt? You’ve just gone white. Let me see what it says. My lord, it’s nothing. Then it doesn’t matter who sees it. I want to see it, and I will. I beg you to forgive me. It’s a small matter, but one that I don’t want to share for certain reasons. I want to see it because of those reasons. I fear—What should you fear? It’s just a bill for some festive clothing for the celebration.
