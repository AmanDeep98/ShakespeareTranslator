Old John of Gaunt, time-honour’d Lancaster,Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,Which then our leisure would not let us hear,Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?I have, my liege.Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;Or worthily, as a good subject should,On some known ground of treachery in him?As near as I could sift him on that argument,On some apparent danger seen in himAim’d at your highness, no inveterate malice.Then call them to our presence; face to face,And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hearThe accuser and the accused freely speak:High-stomach’d are they both, and full of ire,In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.Many years of happy days befalMy gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!#LBSFORGOLDOld John of Gaunt, did you do as you promised and bring your brave son Henry here? I’d like to hear the violent accusation he wanted to make against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray, which I didn’t have time for earlier.I’ve brought him, my lord. Have you asked him if the source of his complaint is an old feud, or if he knows of some treason the duke has committed?As far as I could tell, it’s not some personal malice. My son believes that the duke means to harm you in some way. Then call them both in to see me. I want to hear in person what each has to say. They’re both so proud and full of anger that they act recklessly and don’t listen to reason. May you have many years of happiness, my gracious and loving lord.
