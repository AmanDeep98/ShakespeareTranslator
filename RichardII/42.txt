Why uncle, thou hast many years to live.But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;Thy word is current with him for my death,But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.Thy son is banish’d upon good advice,Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:Why at our justice seem’st thou then to lour?Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.You urged me as a judge; but I had ratherYou would have bid me argue like a father.O, had it been a stranger, not my child,To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:A partial slander sought I to avoid,And in the sentence my own life destroy’d.Alas, I look’d when some of you should say,I was too strict to make mine own away;But you gave leave to my unwilling tongueAgainst my will to do myself this wrong.Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:Six years we banish him, and he shall go.#LBSFORGOLDWhy, uncle, you have many years left to live. But you can’t give me an extra minute of life. You can shorten my days by adding this sorrow, but you can’t add any time. You can cause me to furrow my brow, but you can’t stop a wrinkle from forming. You can order my death with a word, but once I’m dead, nothing can be done to give me another breath. Banishing your son was a good solution, and you agreed to it. Why now do you look so gloomy at my justice? Sometimes a thing that tastes sweet later makes you feel sick. You asked me to be a judge, but I would rather have argued as a father. If it had been a stranger rather than my son, I would have been milder. I wanted to avoid seeming soft, and, in the process, destroyed myself. Alas, I expected someone to say I was too strict in banishing my own son, but you let me agree to this terrible decision. Cousin, farewell. Uncle, say goodbye, too. I’ve banished him for six years, and he must go.
