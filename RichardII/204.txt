Where is the king?What means our cousin, that he stares and looksSo wildly?God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,To have some conference with your grace alone.Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.What is the matter with our cousin now?For ever may my knees grow to the earth,My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouthUnless a pardon ere I rise or speak.Intended or committed was this fault?If on the first, how heinous e’er it be,To win thy after-love I pardon thee.Then give me leave that I may turn the key,That no man enter till my tale be done.Have thy desire.[Within] My liege, beware; look to thyself;Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there.Villain, I’ll make thee safe.Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.#LBSFORGOLDWhere is the king?Why does my cousin stare and look about him so wildly? God save your grace! I beg to speak to you alone.Go away, and leave us here alone.What is the matter with you now? May my knees remain on the ground and my tongue stay silent until you give me your forgiveness. Is it an offense that you have committed or that you planned to commit? If it was planned only, no matter how terrible it is, I’ll forgive you in order to win your love. Then let me lock the door so no one else can come in until I’m finished telling you. Go ahead. (speaking from off-stage) My lord, beware. Watch yourself. You have a traitor with you. Villain, I’ll render you harmless. Hold off from your revenge. You don’t have any reason to be afraid.
