Some honest Christian trust me with a gageThat Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,If he may be repeal’d, to try his honour.These differences shall all rest under gageTill Norfolk be repeal’d: repeal’d he shall be,And, though mine enemy, restored againTo all his lands and signories: when he’s return’d,Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.That honourable day shall ne’er be seen.Many a time hath banish’d Norfolk foughtFor Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,Streaming the ensign of the Christian crossAgainst black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:And toil’d with works of war, retired himselfTo Italy; and there at Venice gaveHis body to that pleasant country’s earth,And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,Under whose colours he had fought so long.Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?As surely as I live, my lord.Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosomOf good old Abraham! Lords appellants,Your differences shall all rest under gageTill we assign you to your days of trial.#LBSFORGOLDSomeone lend me a glove so I can prove that Mowbray lies. Here, I throw down this, so that I may test his honor if he’s ever brought back. All these quarrels will be put on hold until Mowbray is recalled from exile, as he will be. Even though he is my enemy, he’ll be given back his land and titles. And when he comes back, we’ll have his trial against Aumerle. That day will never happen. Many times did Mowbray fight for Jesus Christ in battle and raised the Christian cross against the black pagans, Turks, and Saracens. Exhausted by war, he retired to Italy. He gave his body to its soil in Venice and gave his pure soul to Christ, under whose banner he fought for so long.Why, bishop, is Mowbray dead? As surely as I am alive, my lord. May peace take his sweet soul to Abraham! Lords, we’ll keep all these challenges until we can set days for your trials.
