Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakesIs numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.Well, we may meet again.I fear me, never.#LBSFORGOLDOh, poor duke! The task he must begin is as hard as counting the sand in a desert or drinking all the water in the ocean. For every person who fights with him, there will be thousands who will not. Goodbye immediately and forever.Well, we might meet again.I fear that we wonâ€™t.
