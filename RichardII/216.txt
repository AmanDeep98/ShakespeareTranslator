Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,‘Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?’Was it not so?These were his very words.‘Have I no friend?’ quoth he: he spake it twice,And urged it twice together, did he not?He did.And speaking it, he wistly look’d on me,And who should say, ‘I would thou wert the man’That would divorce this terror from my heart;’Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let’s go:I am the king’s friend, and will rid his foe.#LBSFORGOLDDidn’t you notice the king and hear what he said? “Don’t I have any friends who will rid me of this constant fear?” Didn’t he say that? Those were his exact words. Twice he said, “Don’t I have any friends?” didn’t he? He did. And when he said it, he looked at me intently, as if he were saying, “I wish you were the man who would take this fear away from me.” He means the king at Pomfret. Come, let’s go. I am the king’s friend, and I’ll get rid him of his enemy.
