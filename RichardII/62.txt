O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy landWherein thou liest in reputation sick;And thou, too careless patient as thou art,Commit’st thy anointed body to the cureOf those physicians that first wounded thee:A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;And yet, incaged in so small a verge,The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.O, had thy grandsire with a prophet’s eyeSeen how his son’s son should destroy his sons,From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,Deposing thee before thou wert possess’d,Which art possess’d now to depose thyself.Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,It were a shame to let this land by lease;But for thy world enjoying but this land,Is it not more than shame to shame it so?Landlord of England art thou now, not king:Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou—#LBSFORGOLDOh no!

If your grandfather had been able to see how you were going to destroy this country, he would’ve reached into the future and stopped you. My brother, it is an utter shame to lease parts of England out to others. You aren’t the king of England anymore. You are simply the landlord of England, and you—
