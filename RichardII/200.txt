Make way, unruly woman!After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;Spur post, and get before him to the king,And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.I’ll not be long behind; though I be old,I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:And never will I rise up from the groundTill Bolingbroke have pardon’d thee. Away, be gone!#LBSFORGOLDMake way, you wild woman! Go after him, Aumerle! Take his horse, get to the king before him, and beg forgiveness before he can even accuse you. I’ll be right behind. Though I am old, I can ride as fast as York. I’ll prostrate myself before the king until he has forgiven you. Go on!
