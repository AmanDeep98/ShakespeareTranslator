I am your free dependant.Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.Now will I write letters to Angelo,—The provost, he shall bear them, whose contentsShall witness to him I am near at home,And that, by great injunctions, I am boundTo enter publicly: him I’ll desireTo meet me at the consecrated fountA league below the city; and from thence,By cold gradation and well-balanced form,We shall proceed with Angelo.Here is the head; I’ll carry it myself.Convenient is it. Make a swift return;For I would commune with you of such thingsThat want no ear but yours.I’ll make all speed.(Within) Peace, ho, be here!The tongue of Isabel. She’s come to knowIf yet her brother’s pardon be come hither:But I will keep her ignorant of her good,To make her heavenly comforts of despair,When it is least expected.#LBSFORGOLD
