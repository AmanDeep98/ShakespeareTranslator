Why ‘her unhappy brother’? let me ask,The rather for I now must make you knowI am that Isabella and his sister.Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:Not to be weary with you, he’s in prison.Woe me! for what?For that which, if myself might be his judge,He should receive his punishment in thanks:He hath got his friend with child.Sir, make me not your story.It is true.I would not—though ’tis my familiar sinWith maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,Tongue far from heart—play with all virgins so:I hold you as a thing ensky’d and sainted.By your renouncement an immortal spirit,And to be talk’d with in sincerity,As with a saint.You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, ’tis thus:Your brother and his lover have embraced:As those that feed grow full, as blossoming timeThat from the seedness the bare fallow bringsTo teeming foison, even so her plenteous wombExpresseth his full tilth and husbandry.#LBSFORGOLD
