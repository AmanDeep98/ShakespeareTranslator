I do constantly believe you. The time is come evennow. I shall crave your forbearance a little: maybe I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.I am always bound to you.Very well met, and well come.What is the news from this good deputy?He hath a garden circummured with brick,Whose western side is with a vineyard back’d;And to that vineyard is a planched gate,That makes his opening with this bigger key:This other doth command a little doorWhich from the vineyard to the garden leads;There have I made my promiseUpon the heavy middle of the nightTo call upon him.But shall you on your knowledge find this way?I have ta’en a due and wary note upon’t:With whispering and most guilty diligence,In action all of precept, he did show meThe way twice o’er.Are there no other tokensBetween you ’greed concerning her observance?#LBSFORGOLD
