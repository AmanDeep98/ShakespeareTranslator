You must be sogood, sir, to rise and be put to death.(Within) Away, you rogue, away! I am sleepy.Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you areexecuted, and sleep afterwards.Go in to him, and fetch him out.He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?Very ready, sir.How now, Abhorson? what’s the news with you?Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into yourprayers; for, look you, the warrant’s come.You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am notfitted for ’t.O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep thesounder all the next day.#LBSFORGOLD
