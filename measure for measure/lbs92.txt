When I would pray and think, I think and prayTo several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,As if I did but only chew his name;And in my heart the strong and swelling evilOf my conception. The state, whereon I studiedIs like a good thing, being often read,Grown fear’d and tedious; yea, my gravity,Wherein—let no man hear me—I take pride,Could I with boot change for an idle plume,Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser soulsTo thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:Let’s write good angel on the devil’s horn:’Tis not the devil’s crest.How now! who’s there?One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.Teach her the way.#LBSFORGOLD
