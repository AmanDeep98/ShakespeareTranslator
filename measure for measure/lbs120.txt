Alas, alas!Sweet sister, let me live:What sin you do to save a brother’s life,Nature dispenses with the deed so farThat it becomes a virtue.O you beast!O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?Is’t not a kind of incest, to take lifeFrom thine own sister’s shame? What should I think?Heaven shield my mother play’d my father fair!For such a warped slip of wildernessNe’er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!Die, perish! Might but my bending downReprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:I’ll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,No word to save thee.Nay, hear me, Isabel.O, fie, fie, fie!Thy sin’s not accidental, but a trade.Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:’Tis best thou diest quickly.O hear me, Isabella!#LBSFORGOLD
