If you head and hang all that offend that way butfor ten year together, you’ll be glad to give out acommission for more heads: if this law hold inVienna ten year, I’ll rent the fairest house in itafter three-pence a bay: if you live to see thiscome to pass, say Pompey told you so.Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of yourprophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not findyou before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewdCaesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shallhave you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.I thank your worship for your good counsel:but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shallbetter determine.Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, masterconstable. How long have you been in this place of constable?Seven year and a half, sir.#LBSFORGOLD
