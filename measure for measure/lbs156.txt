(sings) Take, O, take those lips away,That so sweetly were forsworn;And those eyes, the break of day,Lights that do mislead the morn:But my kisses bring again, bring again;Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain.Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:Here comes a man of comfort, whose adviceHath often still’d my brawling discontent.I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wishYou had not found me here so musical:Let me excuse me, and believe me so,My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.’Tis good; though music oft hath such a charmTo make bad good, and good provoke to harm.I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquiredfor me here to-day? much upon this time haveI promised here to meet.You have not been inquired after:I have sat here all day.#LBSFORGOLD
