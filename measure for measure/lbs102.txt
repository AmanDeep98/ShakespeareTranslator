Were not you then as cruel as the sentenceThat you have slander’d so?Ignomy in ransom and free pardonAre of two houses: lawful mercyIs nothing kin to foul redemption.You seem’d of late to make the law a tyrant;And rather proved the sliding of your brotherA merriment than a vice.O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:I something do excuse the thing I hate,For his advantage that I dearly love.We are all frail.Else let my brother die,If not a feodary, but only heOwe and succeed thy weakness.Nay, women are frail too.Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;Which are as easy broke as they make forms.Women! Help Heaven! men their creation marIn profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;For we are soft as our complexions are,And credulous to false prints.#LBSFORGOLD
