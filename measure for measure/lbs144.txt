Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.He shall know you better, sir, if I may live toreport you.I fear you not.O, you hope the duke will return no more; or youimagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed Ican do you little harm; you’ll forswear this again.I’ll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell ifClaudio die to-morrow or no?Why should he die, sir?Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I wouldthe duke we talk of were returned again: theungenitured agent will unpeople the province withcontinency; sparrows must not build in hishouse-eaves, because they are lecherous. The dukeyet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he wouldnever bring them to light: would he were returned!Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. Theduke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton onFridays. He’s not past it yet, and I say to thee,he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brownbread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.#LBSFORGOLD
