Welcome, how agreed?She’ll take the enterprise upon her, father,If you advise it.It is not my consent,But my entreaty too.Little have you to sayWhen you depart from him, but, soft and low,‘Remember now my brother.’Fear me not.Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.He is your husband on a pre-contract:To bring you thus together, ’tis no sin,Sith that the justice of your title to himDoth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:Our corn’s to reap, for yet our tithe’s to sow.#LBSFORGOLD
