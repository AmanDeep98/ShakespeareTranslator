Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was theduke: and I believe I know the cause of hiswithdrawing.What, I prithee, might be the cause?No, pardon; â€™tis a secret must be locked within theteeth and the lips: but this I can let youunderstand, the greater file of the subject held theduke to be wise.Wise! why, no question but he was.A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:the very stream of his life and the business he hathhelmed must upon a warranted need give him a betterproclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his ownbringings-forth, and he shall appear to theenvious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if yourknowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.Sir, I know him, and I love him.Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge withdearer love.Come, sir, I know what I know.I can hardly believe that, since you know not whatyou speak. But, if ever the duke return, as ourprayers are he may, let me desire you to make youranswer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to callupon you; and, I pray you, your name?#LBSFORGOLD
