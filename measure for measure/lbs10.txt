If the duke with the other dukes come not tocomposition with the King of Hungary, why then allthe dukes fall upon the king.Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King ofHungary’s!Amen.Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, thatwent to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scrapedone out of the table.‘Thou shalt not steal’?Ay, that he razed.Why, ’twas a commandment to command the captain andall the rest from their functions: they put forthto steal. There’s not a soldier of us all, that, inthe thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petitionwell that prays for peace.I never heard any soldier dislike it.I believe thee; for I think thou never wast wheregrace was said.No? a dozen times at least.What, in metre?#LBSFORGOLD
