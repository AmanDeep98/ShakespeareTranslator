Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?Is she your cousin?Adoptedly; as school-maids change their namesBy vain though apt affection.She it is.O, let him marry her.This is the point.The duke is very strangely gone from hence;Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,In hand and hope of action: but we do learnBy those that know the very nerves of state,His givings-out were of an infinite distanceFrom his true-meant design. Upon his place,And with full line of his authority,Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose bloodIs very snow-broth; one who never feelsThe wanton stings and motions of the sense,But doth rebate and blunt his natural edgeWith profits of the mind, study and fast.He—to give fear to use and liberty,Which have for long run by the hideous law,As mice by lions—hath pick’d out an act,Under whose heavy sense your brother’s lifeFalls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;And follows close the rigour of the statute,To make him an example. All hope is gone,Unless you have the grace by your fair prayerTo soften Angelo: and that’s my pith of business’Twixt you and your poor brother.#LBSFORGOLD
