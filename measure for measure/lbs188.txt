Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: dowe jest now, think you?Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastilyyou are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfortyou and pray with you.Friar, not I: I have been drinking hard all night,and I will have more time to prepare me, or theyshall beat out my brains with billets: I will notconsent to die this day, that’s certain.O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech youLook forward on the journey you shall go.I swear I will not die to-day for any man’spersuasion.But hear you.Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!After him, fellows; bring him to the block.Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?#LBSFORGOLD
