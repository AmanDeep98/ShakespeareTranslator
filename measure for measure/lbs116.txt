Why give you me this shame?Think you I can a resolution fetchFrom flowery tenderness? If I must die,I will encounter darkness as a bride,And hug it in mine arms.There spake my brother; there my father’s graveDid utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:Thou art too noble to conserve a lifeIn base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,Whose settled visage and deliberate wordNips youth i’ the head and follies doth emmewAs falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devilHis filth within being cast, he would appearA pond as deep as hell.The prenzie Angelo!O, ’tis the cunning livery of hell,The damned’st body to invest and coverIn prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?If I would yield him my virginity,Thou mightst be freed.O heavens! it cannot be.Yes, he would give’t thee, from this rank offence,So to offend him still. This night’s the timeThat I should do what I abhor to name,Or else thou diest to-morrow.#LBSFORGOLD
