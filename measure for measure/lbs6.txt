Now, good my lord,Let there be some more test made of my metal,Before so noble and so great a figureBe stamp’d upon it.No more evasion:We have with a leaven’d and prepared choiceProceeded to you; therefore take your honours.Our haste from hence is of so quick conditionThat it prefers itself and leaves unquestion’dMatters of needful value. We shall write to you,As time and our concernings shall importune,How it goes with us, and do look to knowWhat doth befall you here. So, fare you well;To the hopeful execution do I leave youOf your commissions.Yet give leave, my lord,That we may bring you something on the way.My haste may not admit it;Nor need you, on mine honour, have to doWith any scruple; your scope is as mine ownSo to enforce or qualify the lawsAs to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:I’ll privily away. I love the people,But do not like to stage me to their eyes:Through it do well, I do not relish wellTheir loud applause and Aves vehement;Nor do I think the man of safe discretionThat does affect it. Once more, fare you well.#LBSFORGOLD
