Could great men thunderAs Jove himself does, Jove would ne’er be quiet,For every pelting, petty officerWould use his heaven for thunder;Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous boltSplit’st the unwedgeable and gnarled oakThan the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,Drest in a little brief authority,Most ignorant of what he’s most assured,His glassy essence, like an angry ape,Plays such fantastic tricks before high heavenAs make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,Would all themselves laugh mortal.[Aside to ISABELLA] O, to him, to him, wench! hewill relent;He’s coming; I perceive ’t.[Aside] Pray heaven she win him!We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:Great men may jest with saints; ’tis wit in them,But in the less foul profanation.Thou’rt i’ the right, girl; more o, that.That in the captain’s but a choleric word,Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.#LBSFORGOLD
