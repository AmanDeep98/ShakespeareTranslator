I thought, by your readiness in the office, you hadcontinued in it some time. You say, seven years together?And a half, sir.Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do youwrong to put you so oft upon ’t: are there not menin your ward sufficient to serve it?Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as theyare chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; Ido it for some piece of money, and go through withall.Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,the most sufficient of your parish.To your worship’s house, sir?To my house. Fare you well.What’s o’clock, think you?Eleven, sir.I pray you home to dinner with me.I humbly thank you.It grieves me for the death of Claudio;But there’s no remedy.Lord Angelo is severe.It is but needful:Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:But yet,—poor Claudio! There is no remedy.Come, sir.#LBSFORGOLD#LBSFORGOLD
