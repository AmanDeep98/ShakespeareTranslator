O heavens!Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,Making both it unable for itself,And dispossessing all my other partsOf necessary fitness?So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;Come all to help him, and so stop the airBy which he should revive: and even soThe general, subject to a well-wish’d king,Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondnessCrowd to his presence, where their untaught loveMust needs appear offence.How now, fair maid?I am come to know your pleasure.That you might know it, would much better please meThan to demand what ’tis. Your brother cannot live.Even so. Heaven keep your honour!Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,As long as you or I: yet he must die.Under your sentence?#LBSFORGOLD
