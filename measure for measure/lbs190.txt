A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;And to transport him in the mind he isWere damnable.Here in the prison, father,There died this morning of a cruel feverOne Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,A man of Claudio’s years; his beard and headJust of his colour. What if we do omitThis reprobate till he were well inclined;And satisfy the deputy with the visageOf Ragozine, more like to Claudio?O, ’tis an accident that heaven provides!Dispatch it presently; the hour draws onPrefix’d by Angelo: see this be done,And sent according to command; whiles IPersuade this rude wretch willingly to die.This shall be done, good father, presently.But Barnardine must die this afternoon:And how shall we continue Claudio,To save me from the danger that might comeIf he were known alive?Let this be done.Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greetingTo the under generation, you shall findYour safety manifested.#LBSFORGOLD
