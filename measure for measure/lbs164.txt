Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man’s head?If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be amarried man, he’s his wife’s heada pun, referring both to the Biblical idea of the husband as the head of the wife (Ephesians 5:23) and the husband owning his wife’s maidenhead (virginity)wife’s head, and I can nevercut off a woman’s head.Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me adirect answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudioand Barnardine. Here is in our prison a commonexecutioner, who in his office lacks a helper: ifyou will take it on you to assist him, it shallredeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall haveyour full time of imprisonment and your deliverancewith an unpitied whipping, for you have been anotorious bawd.Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. Iwould be glad to receive some instruction from myfellow partner.What, ho! Abhorson! Where’s Abhorson, there?Do you call, sir?Sirrah, here’s a fellow will help you to-morrow inyour execution. If you think it meet, compound withhim by the year, and let him abide here with you; ifnot, use him for the present and dismiss him. Hecannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.#LBSFORGOLD
