Why, how now, Claudio! Whence comes this restraint?From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:As surfeit is the father of much fast,So every scope by the immoderate useTurns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.If I could speak so wisely under an arrest, I wouldsend for certain of my creditors: and yet, to saythe truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedomas the morality of imprisonment. What’s thyoffence, Claudio?What but to speak of would offend again.What, is’t murder?No.Lechery?Call it so.Away, sir, you must go.One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.A hundred, if they’ll do you any good.Is lechery so look’d after?Thus stands it with me: upon a true contractI got possession of Julietta’s bed:You know the lady; she is fast my wife,Save that we do the denunciation lackOf outward order: this we came not to,Only for propagation of a dowerRemaining in the coffer of her friends,From whom we thought it meet to hide our loveTill time had made them for us. But it chancesThe stealth of our most mutual entertainmentWith character too gross is writ on Juliet.#LBSFORGOLD
