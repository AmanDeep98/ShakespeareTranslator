Yea.When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,Longer or shorter, he may be so fittedThat his soul sicken not.Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as goodTo pardon him that hath from nature stolenA man already made, as to remitTheir saucy sweetness that do coin heaven’s imageIn stamps that are forbid: ’tis all as easyFalsely to take away a life true madeAs to put metal in restrained meansTo make a false one.’Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.Which had you rather, that the most just lawNow took your brother’s life; or, to redeem him,Give up your body to such sweet uncleannessAs she that he hath stain’d?Sir, believe this,I had rather give my body than my soul.I talk not of your soul: our compell’d sinsStand more for number than for accompt.How say you?#LBSFORGOLD
