[Aside to ISABELLA] Art avised o’ that? more on ’t.Why do you put these sayings upon me?Because authority, though it err like others,Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,That skins the vice o’ the top. Go to your bosom;Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth knowThat’s like my brother’s fault: if it confessA natural guiltiness such as is his,Let it not sound a thought upon your tongueAgainst my brother’s life.[Aside] She speaks, and ’tisSuch sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well.Gentle my lord, turn back.I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.Hark how I’ll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.How! bribe me?Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.[Aside to ISABELLA] You had marr’d all else.Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,Or stones whose rates are either rich or poorAs fancy values them; but with true prayersThat shall be up at heaven and enter thereEre sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,From fasting maids whose minds are dedicateTo nothing temporal.#LBSFORGOLD
