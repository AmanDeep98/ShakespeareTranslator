No might nor greatness in mortalityCan censure ’scape; back-wounding calumnyThe whitest virtue strikes. What king so strongCan tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?But who comes here?Go; away with her to prison!Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounteda merciful man; good my lord.Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit inthe same kind! This would make mercy swear and playthe tyrant.A bawd of eleven years’ continuance, may it pleaseyour honour.My lord, this is one Lucio’s information against me.Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in theduke’s time; he promised her marriage: his childis a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him becalled before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;no more words.#LBSFORGOLD
