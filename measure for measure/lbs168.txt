You, sirrah, provide your block and your axeto-morrow four o’clock.Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you haveoccasion to use me for your own turn, you shall findme yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe youa good turn.Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:The one has my pity; not a jot the other,Being a murderer, though he were my brother.Look, here’s the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:’Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrowThou must be made immortal. Where’s Barnardine?As fast lock’d up in sleep as guiltless labourWhen it lies starkly in the traveller’s bones:He will not wake.Who can do good on him?Well, go, prepare yourself.But, hark, what noise?Heaven give your spirits comfort!#LBSFORGOLD
