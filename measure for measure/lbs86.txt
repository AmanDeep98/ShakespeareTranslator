Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.I am the provost. What’s your will, good friar?Bound by my charity and my blest order,I come to visit the afflicted spiritsHere in the prison. Do me the common rightTo let me see them and to make me knowThe nature of their crimes, that I may ministerTo them accordingly.I would do more than that, if more were needful.Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,Hath blister’d her report: she is with child;And he that got it, sentenced; a young manMore fit to do another such offenceThan die for this.When must he die?As I do think, to-morrow.I have provided for you: stay awhile,And you shall be conducted.#LBSFORGOLD
