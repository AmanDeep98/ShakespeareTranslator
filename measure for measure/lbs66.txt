He’s hearing of a cause; he will come straightI’ll tell him of you.Pray you, do.I’ll knowHis pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,He hath but as offended in a dream!All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and heTo die for’t!Now, what’s the matter. Provost?Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?Did not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order?Why dost thou ask again?Lest I might be too rash:Under your good correction, I have seen,When, after execution, judgment hathRepented o’er his doom.Go to; let that be mine:Do you your office, or give up your place,And you shall well be spared.#LBSFORGOLD
