He’s in the right. Constable, what say you to it?First, an it like you, the house is a respectedhouse; next, this is a respected fellow; and hismistress is a respected woman.By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respectedperson than any of us all.Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! Thetime has yet to come that she was ever respectedwith man, woman, or child.Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Isthis true?O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wickedHannibal! I respected with her before I was marriedto her! If ever I was respected with her, or shewith me, let not your worship think me the poorduke’s officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, orI’ll have mine action of battery on thee.If he took you a box o’ the ear, you might have youraction of slander too.Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is’tyour worship’s pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in himthat thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let himcontinue in his courses till thou knowest what theyare.#LBSFORGOLD
