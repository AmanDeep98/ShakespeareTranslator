Peace be in this place!Who’s that which calls?It is a man’s voice. Gentle Isabella,Turn you the key, and know his business of him;You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.When you have vow’d, you must not speak with menBut in the presence of the prioreThen, if you speak, you must not show your face,Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.He calls again; I pray you, answer him.Peace and prosperity!
