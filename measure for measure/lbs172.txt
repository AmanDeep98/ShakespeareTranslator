That spirit’s possessed with hasteThat wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.There he must stay until the officerArise to let him in: he is call’d up.Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,But he must die to-morrow?None, sir, none.As near the dawning, provost, as it is,You shall hear more ere morning.HappilyYou something know; yet I believe there comesNo countermand; no such example have we:Besides, upon the very siege of justiceLord Angelo hath to the public earProfess’d the contrary.This is his lordship’s man.#LBSFORGOLD
