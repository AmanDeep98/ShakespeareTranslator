I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.This will last out a night in Russia,When nights are longest there: I’ll take my leave.And leave you to the hearing of the cause;Hoping you’ll find good cause to whip them all.I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow’s wife, once more?Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.I beseech your honour, ask me.Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman’s face.Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; ’tis for agood purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?Ay, sir, very well.Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.Well, I do so.Doth your honour see any harm in his face?Why, no.I’ll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worstthing about him. Good, then; if his face be theworst thing about him, how could Master Froth do theconstable’s wife any harm? I would know that ofyour honour.#LBSFORGOLD
