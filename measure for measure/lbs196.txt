I am directed by you.This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;’Tis that he sent me of the duke’s return:Say, by this token, I desire his companyAt Mariana’s house to-night. Her cause and yoursI’ll perfect him withal, and he shall bring youBefore the duke, and to the head of AngeloAccuse him home and home. For my poor self,I am combined by a sacred vowAnd shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:Command these fretting waters from your eyesWith a light heart; trust not my holy order,If I pervert your course. Who’s here?Good even. Friar, where’s the provost?Not within, sir.O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to seethine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fainto dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not formy head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would setme to ’t. But they say the duke will be hereto-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had beenat home, he had lived.#LBSFORGOLD
