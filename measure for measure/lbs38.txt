Doth he so seek his life?Has censured himAlready; and, as I hear, the provost hathA warrant for his execution.Alas! what poor ability’s in meTo do him good?Assay the power you have.My power? Alas, I doubt—Our doubts are traitorsAnd make us lose the good we oft might winBy fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,All their petitions are as freely theirsAs they themselves would owe them.I’ll see what I can do.But speedily.I will about it straight;No longer staying but to give the motherNotice of my affair. I humbly thank you:Commend me to my brother: soon at nightI’ll send him certain word of my success.I take my leave of you.#LBSFORGOLD
