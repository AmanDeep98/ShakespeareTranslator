I would to heaven I had your potency,And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?No; I would tell what ’twere to be a judge,And what a prisoner.[Aside to ISABELLA] Ay, touch him; there’s the vein.Your brother is a forfeit of the law,And you but waste your words.Alas, alas!Why, all the souls that were forfeit once;And He that might the vantage best have tookFound out the remedy. How would you be,If He, which is the top of judgment, shouldBut judge you as you are? O, think on that;And mercy then will breathe within your lips,Like man new made.Be you content, fair maid;It is the law, not I condemn your brother:Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.To-morrow! O, that’s sudden! Spare him, spare him!He’s not prepared for death. Even for our kitchensWe kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heavenWith less respect than we do ministerTo our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;Who is it that hath died for this offence?There’s many have committed it.#LBSFORGOLD
