So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?The miserable have no other medicineBut only hope:I’ve hope to live, and am prepared to die.Be absolute for death; either death or lifeShall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:If I do lose thee, I do lose a thingThat none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,Servile to all the skyey influences,That dost this habitation, where thou keep’st,Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death’s fool;For him thou labour’st by thy flight to shunAnd yet runn’st toward him still. Thou art not noble;For all the accommodations that thou bear’stAre nursed by baseness. Thou’rt by no means valiant;For thou dost fear the soft and tender forkOf a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear’stThy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;For thou exist’st on many a thousand grainsThat issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,And what thou hast, forget’st. Thou art not certain;For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,After the moon. If thou art rich, thou’rt poor;For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,Thou bear’s thy heavy riches but a journey,And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,The mere effusion of thy proper loins,Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,But, as it were, an after-dinner’s sleep,Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youthBecomes as aged, and doth beg the almsOf palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,To make thy riches pleasant. What’s yet in thisThat bears the name of life? Yet in this lifeLie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,That makes these odds all even.#LBSFORGOLD
