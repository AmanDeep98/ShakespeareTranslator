Nay, I’ll not warrant that; for I can speakAgainst the thing I say. Answer to this:I, now the voice of the recorded law,Pronounce a sentence on your brother’s life:Might there not be a charity in sinTo save this brother’s life?Please you to do’t,I’ll take it as a peril to my soul,It is no sin at all, but charity.Pleased you to do’t at peril of your soul,Were equal poise of sin and charity.That I do beg his life, if it be sin,Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,If that be sin, I’ll make it my morn prayerTo have it added to the faults of mine,And nothing of your answer.Nay, but hear me.Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,Or seem so craftily; and that’s not good.Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,But graciously to know I am no better.Thus wisdom wishes to appear most brightWhen it doth tax itself; as these black masksProclaim an enshield beauty ten times louderThan beauty could, display’d. But mark me;To be received plain, I’ll speak more groYour brother is to die.#LBSFORGOLD
