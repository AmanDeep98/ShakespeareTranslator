Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to yourreports; but the best is, he lives not in them.Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:he’s a better woodman than thou takest him for.Well, you’ll answer this one day. Fare ye well.Nay, tarry; I’ll go along with theeI can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.You have told me too many of him already, sir, ifthey be true; if not true, none were enough.I was once before him for getting a wench with child.Did you such a thing?Yes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswear it;they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.By my troth, I’ll go with thee to the lane’s end:if bawdy talk offend you, we’ll have very little ofit. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.#LBSFORGOLD
