No, holy father; throw away that thought;Believe not that the dribbling dart of loveCan pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire theeTo give me secret harbour, hath a purposeMore grave and wrinkled than the aims and endsOf burning youth.May your grace speak of it?My holy sir, none better knows than youHow I have ever loved the life removedAnd held in idle price to haunt assembliesWhere youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.I have deliver’d to Lord Angelo,A man of stricture and firm abstinence,My absolute power and place here in Vienna,And he supposes me travell’d to Poland;For so I have strew’d it in the common ear,And so it is received. Now, pious sir,You will demand of me why I do this?Gladly, my lord.We have strict statutes and most biting laws.The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;Even like an o’ergrown lion in a cave,That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,Only to stick it in their children’s sightFor terror, not to use, in time the rodBecomes more mock’d than fear’d; so our decrees,Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;And liberty plucks justice by the nose;The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwartGoes all decorum.#LBSFORGOLD
