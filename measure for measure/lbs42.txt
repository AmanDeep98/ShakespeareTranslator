We must not make a scarecrow of the law,Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,And let it keep one shape, till custom make itTheir perch and not their terror.Ay, but yetLet us be keen, and rather cut a little,Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentlemanWhom I would save had a most noble father!Let but your honour know,Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,That, in the working of your own affections,Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,Or that the resolute acting of your bloodCould have attain’d the effect of your own purpose,Whether you had not sometime in your lifeErr’d in this point which now you censure him,And pull’d the law upon you.’Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,Another thing to fall. I not deny,The jury, passing on the prisoner’s life,May in the sworn twelve have a thief or twoGuiltier than him they try. What’s open made to justice,That justice seizes: what know the lawsThat thieves do pass on thieves? ’Tis very pregnant,The jewel that we find, we stoop and take’tBecause we see it; but what we do not seeWe tread upon, and never think of it.You may not so extenuate his offenceFor I have had such faults; but rather tell me,When I, that censure him, do so offend,Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.#LBSFORGOLD
