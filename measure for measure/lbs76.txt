[Aside to ISABELLA] Ay, well said.The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:Those many had not dared to do that evil,If the first that did the edict infringeHad answer’d for his deed: now ’tis awakeTakes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,And so in progress to be hatch’d and born,Are now to have no successive degrees,But, ere they live, to end.Yet show some pity.I show it most of all when I show justice;For then I pity those I do not know,Which a dismiss’d offence would after gall;And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.So you must be the first that gives this sentence,And he, that suffer’s. O, it is excellentTo have a giant’s strength; but it is tyrannousTo use it like a giant.[Aside to ISABELLA] That’s well said.#LBSFORGOLD
