The heavens give safety to your purposes!Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!I thank you. Fare you well.I shall desire you, sir, to give me leaveTo have free speech with you; and it concerns meTo look into the bottom of my place:A power I have, but of what strength and natureI am not yet instructed.’Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,And we may soon our satisfaction haveTouching that point.I’ll wait upon your honour.#LBSFORGOLD
