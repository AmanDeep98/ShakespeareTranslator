My very worthy cousin, fairly met!Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.Happy return be to your royal grace!Many and hearty thankings to you both.We have made inquiry of you; and we hearSuch goodness of your justice, that our soulCannot but yield you forth to public thanks,Forerunning more requital.You make my bonds still greater.O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,When it deserves, with characters of brass,A forted residence â€™gainst the tooth of timeAnd razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,And let the subject see, to make them knowThat outward courtesies would fain proclaimFavours that keep within. Come, Escalus,You must walk by us on our other hand;And good supporters are you.Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.#LBSFORGOLD
