Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.What is your will?Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by andby have some speech with you: the satisfaction Iwould require is likewise your own benefit.I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must bestolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.Son, I have overheard what hath passed between youand your sister. Angelo had never the purpose tocorrupt her; only he hath made an essay of hervirtue to practise his judgment with the dispositionof natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,hath made him that gracious denial which he is mostglad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and Iknow this to be true; therefore prepare yourself todeath: do not satisfy your resolution with hopesthat are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go toyour knees and make ready.Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of lovewith life that I will sue to be rid of it.Hold you there: farewell.#LBSFORGOLD
