Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What’s yourname, Master tapster?Pompey.What else?Bum, sir.Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey theGreat. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are younot? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? Whatdo you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?If the law would allow it, sir.But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shallnot be allowed in Vienna.Does your worship mean to geld and splay all theyouth of the city?No, Pompey.Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to’t then.If your worship will take order for the drabs andthe knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:it is but heading and hanging.#LBSFORGOLD
