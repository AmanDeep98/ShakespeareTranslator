And you.Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?Come your ways, sir; come.You will not bail me, then, sir?Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?what news?Come your ways, sir; come.Go to kennel, Pompey; go.What news, friar, of the duke?I know none. Can you tell me of any?Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; othersome, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal fromthe state, and usurp the beggary he was never bornto. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; heputs transgression to ’t.He does well in ’t.A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm inhim: something too crabbed that way, friar.It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirpit quite, friar, till eating and drinking be putdown. They say this Angelo was not made by man andwoman after this downright way of creation: is ittrue, think you?#LBSFORGOLD
