So.And his offence is so, as it appears,Accountant to the law upon that pain.True.Admit no other way to save his life,—As I subscribe not that, nor any other,But in the loss of question,—that you, his sister,Finding yourself desired of such a person,Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,Could fetch your brother from the manaclesOf the all-building law; and that there wereNo earthly mean to save him, but that eitherYou must lay down the treasures of your bodyTo this supposed, or else to let him suffer;What would you do?As much for my poor brother as myself:That is, were I under the terms of death,The impression of keen whips I’ld wear as rubies,And strip myself to death, as to a bedThat longing have been sick for, ere I’ld yieldMy body up to shame.Then must your brother die.And ’twere the cheaper way:Better it were a brother died at once,Than that a sister, by redeeming him,Should die for ever.#LBSFORGOLD
