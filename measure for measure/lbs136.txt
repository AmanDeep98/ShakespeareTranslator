Still thus, and thus; still worse!How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures shestill, ha?Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is herself in the tub“beef” can mean actual meat or prostitutes; “tub” can mean a pickling tub for curing meat, or a sweat-tub to treat venereal disease.she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is herself in the tub.Why, ’tis good; it is the right of it; it must beso: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art goingto prison, Pompey?Yes, faith, sir.Why, ’tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say Isent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?For being a bawd, for being a bawd.Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be thedue of a bawd, why, ’tis his right: bawd is hedoubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; youwill keep the house.I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: Ifyou take it not patiently, why, your mettle is themore. Adieu, trusty Pompey. ’Bless you, friar.#LBSFORGOLD
