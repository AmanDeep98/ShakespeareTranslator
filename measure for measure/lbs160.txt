No, none, but only a repair i’ the dark;And that I have possess’d him my most stayCan be but brief; for I have made him knowI have a servant comes with me along,That stays upon me, whose persuasion isI come about my brother.’Tis well borne up.I have not yet made known to MarianaA word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;She comes to do you good.I do desire the like.Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.Take, then, this your companion by the hand,Who hath a story ready for your ear.I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;The vaporous night approaches.Will’t please you walk aside?O place and greatness! millions of false eyesAre stuck upon thee: volumes of reportRun with these false and most contrarious questsUpon thy doings: thousand escapes of witMake thee the father of their idle dreamsAnd rack thee in their fancies.#LBSFORGOLD
