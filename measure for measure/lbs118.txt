Thou shalt not do’t.O, were it but my life,I’ld throw it down for your deliveranceAs frankly as a pin.Thanks, dear Isabel.Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.Yes. Has he affections in him,That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.Which is the least?If it were damnable, he being so wise,Why would he for the momentary trickBe perdurably fined? O Isabel!What says my brother?Death is a fearful thing.And shamed life a hateful.Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;This sensible warm motion to becomeA kneaded clod; and the delighted spiritTo bathe in fiery floods, or to resideIn thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;To be imprison’d in the viewless winds,And blown with restless violence round aboutThe pendent world; or to be worse than worstOf those that lawless and incertain thoughtImagine howling: ’tis too horrible!The weariest and most loathed worldly lifeThat age, ache, penury and imprisonmentCan lay on nature is a paradiseTo what we fear of death.#LBSFORGOLD
