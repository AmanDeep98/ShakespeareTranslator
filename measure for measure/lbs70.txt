Well; what’s your suit?There is a vice that most I do abhor,And most desire should meet the blow of justice;For which I would not plead, but that I must;For which I must not plead, but that I amAt war ’twixt will and will not.Well; the matter?I have a brother is condemn’d to die:I do beseech you, let it be his fault,And not my brother.[Aside] Heaven give thee moving graces!Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?Why, every fault’s condemn’d ere it be done:Mine were the very cipher of a function,To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,And let go by the actor.O just but severe law!I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour![Aside to ISABELLA] Give’t not o’er so: to himagain, entreat him;Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:You are too cold; if you should need a pin,You could not with more tame a tongue desire it:To him, I say!#LBSFORGOLD
