By and by.I hope it is some pardon or reprieveFor the most gentle Claudio.Welcome father.The best and wholesomest spirts of the nightEnvelope you, good Provost! Who call’d here of late?None, since the curfew rung.Not Isabel?No.They will, then, ere’t be long.What comfort is for Claudio?There’s some in hope.It is a bitter deputy.Not so, not so; his life is parallel’dEven with the stroke and line of his great justice:He doth with holy abstinence subdueThat in himself which he spurs on his powerTo qualify in others: were he meal’d with thatWhich he corrects, then were he tyrannous;But this being so, he’s just.#LBSFORGOLD
