Must he needs die?Maiden, no remedy.Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.I will not do’t.But can you, if you would?Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.But might you do’t, and do the world no wrong,If so your heart were touch’d with that remorseAs mine is to him?He’s sentenced; ’tis too late.[Aside to ISABELLA] You are too cold.Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.May call it back again. Well, believe this,No ceremony that to great ones ’longs,Not the king’s crown, nor the deputed sword,The marshal’s truncheon, nor the judge’s robe,Become them with one half so good a graceAs mercy does.If he had been as you and you as he,You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,Would not have been so stern.Pray you, be gone.#LBSFORGOLD
