If it please your honour, I know not well what theyare: but precise villains they are, that I am sureof; and void of all profanation in the world thatgood Christians ought to have.This comes off well; here’s a wise officer.Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is yourname? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?He cannot, sir; he’s out at elbow.What are you, sir?He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one thatserves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as theysay, plucked down in the suburbs; and now sheprofesses a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.How know you that?My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,—(confusing detest with attest)How? thy wife?Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,—Dost thou detest her therefore?I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well asshe, that this house, if it be not a bawd’s house,it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.How dost thou know that, constable?#LBSFORGOLD
