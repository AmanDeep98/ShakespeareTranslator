What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in theafternoon?A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; onethat is a prisoner nine years old.How came it that the absent duke had not eitherdelivered him to his liberty or executed him? Ihave heard it was ever his manner to do so.His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,indeed, his fact, till now in the government of LordAngelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.It is now apparent?Most manifest, and not denied by himself.Hath he born himself penitently in prison? howseems he to be touched?A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully butas a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearlessof whatâ€™s past, present, or to come; insensible ofmortality, and desperately mortal.He wants advice.He will hear none: he hath evermore had the libertyof the prison; give him leave to escape hence, hewould not: drunk many times a day, if not many daysentirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as ifto carry him to execution, and showed him a seemingwarrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.#LBSFORGOLD
