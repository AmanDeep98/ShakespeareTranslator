I crave your honour’s pardon.What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?She’s very near her hour.Dispose of herTo some more fitter place, and that with speed.Here is the sister of the man condemn’dDesires access to you.Hath he a sister?Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,And to be shortly of a sisterhood,If not already.Well, let her be admitted.See you the fornicatress be removed:Let have needful, but not lavish, means;There shall be order for’t.God save your honour!Stay a little while.You’re welcome: what’s your will?I am a woeful suitor to your honour,Please but your honour hear me.#LBSFORGOLD
