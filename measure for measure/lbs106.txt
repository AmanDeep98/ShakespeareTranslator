Who will believe thee, Isabel?My unsoil’d name, the austereness of my life,My vouch against you, and my place i’ the state,Will so your accusation overweigh,That you shall stifle in your own reportAnd smell of calumny. I have begun,And now I give my sensual race the rein:Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brotherBy yielding up thy body to my will;Or else he must not only die the death,But thy unkindness shall his death draw outTo lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,Or, by the affection that now guides me most,I’ll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,Say what you can, my false o’erweighs your true.To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,Either of condemnation or approof;Bidding the law make court’sy to their will:Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,To follow as it draws! I’ll to my brother:Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.That, had he twenty heads to tender downOn twenty bloody blocks, he’ld yield them up,Before his sister should her body stoopTo such abhorr’d pollution.Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:More than our brother is our chastity.I’ll tell him yet of Angelo’s request,And fit his mind to death, for his soul’s rest.#LBSFORGOLD#LBSFORGOLD
