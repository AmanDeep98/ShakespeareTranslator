Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?I do; and bear the shame most patiently.I’ll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,And try your penitence, if it be sound,Or hollowly put on.I’ll gladly learn.Love you the man that wrong’d you?Yes, as I love the woman that wrong’d him.So then it seems your most offenceful actWas mutually committed?Mutually.Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.I do confess it, and repent it, father.’Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,But as we stand in fear,—I do repent me, as it is an evil,And take the shame with joy.There rest.Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,And I am going with instruction to him.Grace go with you, Benedicite!#LBSFORGOLD
