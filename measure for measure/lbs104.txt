I think it well:And from this testimony of your own sex,—Since I suppose we are made to be no strongerThan faults may shake our frames,—let me be bold;I do arrest your words. Be that you are,That is, a woman; if you be more, you’re none;If you be one, as you are well express’dBy all external warrants, show it now,By putting on the destined livery.I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,Let me entreat you speak the former language.Plainly conceive, I love you.My brother did love Juliet,And you tell me that he shall die for it.He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.I know your virtue hath a licence in’t,Which seems a little fouler than it is,To pluck on others.Believe me, on mine honour,My words express my purpose.Ha! little honour to be much believed,And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for’t:Sign me a present pardon for my brother,Or with an outstretch’d throat I’ll tell the world aloudWhat man thou art.#LBSFORGOLD
