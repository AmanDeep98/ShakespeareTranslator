None, but such remedy as, to save a head,To cleave a heart in twain.But is there any?Yes, brother, you may live:There is a devilish mercy in the judge,If you’ll implore it, that will free your life,But fetter you till death.Perpetual durance?Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,Though all the world’s vastidity you had,To a determined scope.But in what nature?In such a one as, you consenting to’t,Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,And leave you naked.Let me know the point.O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,And six or seven winters more respectThan a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?The sense of death is most in apprehension;And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,In corporal sufferance finds a pang as greatAs when a giant dies.#LBSFORGOLD
