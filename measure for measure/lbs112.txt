I humbly thank you.To sue to live, I find I seek to die;And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.[Within] What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!Who’s there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.Dear sir, ere long I’ll visit you again.Most holy sir, I thank you.My business is a word or two with Claudio.And very welcome. Look, signior, here’s your sister.Provost, a word with you.As many as you please.Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.Now, sister, what’s the comfort?Why,As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,Intends you for his swift ambassador,Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:Therefore your best appointment make with speed;To-morrow you set on.Is there no remedy?#LBSFORGOLD
