Nay, rather let me have it as you are a false thief.Go to. Homo is a common name to all men. Bid the ostler
bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell, you muddy
knave.
#LBSFORGOLDI’d rather have you swear by your reputation as a dishonest thief.Whatever. I’m a true man, even if I’m a dishonest thief. Tell the stable-boy to get my horse. Farewell, you fool.
