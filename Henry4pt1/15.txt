Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a time
and oft.
Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?No, I’ll give thee thy due. Thou hast paid all there.Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch, and
where it would not, I have used my credit.
Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent that thou
art heir apparent—But I prithee, sweet wag, shall there be
gallows standing in England when thou art king? And
resolution thus fubbed as it is with the rusty curb of old father Antic the law?
Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.
No, thou shalt.Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I’ll be a brave judge.Thou judgest false already: I mean thou shalt have the
hanging of the thieves, and so become a rare hangman.
Well, Hal, well, and in some sort it jumps with my humor as
well as waiting in the court, I can tell you.
For obtaining of suits?#LBSFORGOLDYou’ve asked her for the billShakespeare’s line had the added suggestion that Hal has slept with the hostess.bill enough times.Did I ever ask you to pay for any of it?No. I’ve got to admit, you’ve settled with her all by yourself.And not just with her, but wherever my cash was good. And when I ran out, I switched to credit.And you’ve stretched that so far that if it weren’t “here apparent” that you’re the “heir apparent,” your credit wouldn’t be worth a thing. But listen, pretty boy. Will England still have hangmen when you’re king? And will a thief’s courage still be thwarted by that nasty old clown, the law? When you’re king, don’t hang thieves.No. You will.I will? Excellent! By God, I’ll be a great judge.You’ve judged wrong already. I mean, you’ll be in charge of hanging thieves, and become a superb hangman.All right, Hal. I’ll tell you this: in a way, being a hangman agrees with me just as well as hanging around the court.Waiting to get your suitssuits = petitionssuits granted?
