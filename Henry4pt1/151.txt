Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and IMust have some private conference, but be near at hand,For we shall presently have need of you.I know not whether God will have it soFor some displeasing service I have done,That, in his secret doom, out of my bloodHe’ll breed revengement and a scourge for me.But thou dost in thy passages of lifeMake me believe that thou art only markedFor the hot vengeance and the rod of heavenTo punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,Could such inordinate and low desires,Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,Such barren pleasures, rude societyAs thou art matched withal, and grafted to,Accompany the greatness of thy blood,And hold their level with thy princely heart?So please your Majesty, I would I couldQuit all offenses with as clear excuseAs well as I am doubtless I can purgeMyself of many I am charged withal.Yet such extenuation let me begAs, in reproof of many tales devised,Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,By smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers,I may for some things true, wherein my youthHath faulty wandered and irregular,Find pardon on my true submission.#LBSFORGOLDGentlemen, please leave; the Prince of Wales and I must speak in private. But stay close by, for I’ll need you in a moment.I don’t know whether God decided, because of some displeasing crime I have committed, to turn my own flesh and blood into a punisher and a plague upon me. The course of your life has me convinced that you are only meant for one purpose in this world: to be God’s vengeance against me for all my misdeeds. Why else would such disorderly and low desires, such poor, such wretched, such lewd, such despicable actions, such wasteful pleasures, and such vulgar company become associated with your high-born self, and call themselves equals with a Prince like you?Your majesty, I wish I could be proven innocent of all those accusations, for I can certainly clear myself of many of them. But let me beg one favor of you: if I can demonstrate that I’m not guilty of the false charges of these smiling flatterers and wretched gossips (the kinds of stories that are always told about great men), then you will forgive me when I confess to the youthful indiscretions I actually did commit.
