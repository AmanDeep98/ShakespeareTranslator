Heigh-ho! An it be not four by the day, I’ll be hanged.
Charles’s Wain is over the new chimney, and yet our horse
not packed.—What, ostler!

(within) Anon, anon.I prithee, Tom, beat Cut’s saddle. Put a few flocks in the
point. Poor jade is wrung in the withers out of all cess.
Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that is the
next way to give poor jades the bots. This house is turned upside
down since Robin ostler died.
Poor fellow never joyed since the price of oats rose. It was
the death of him.
I think this be the most villanous house in all London road
for fleas. I am stung like a tench.
Like a tench? By the Mass, there is ne'er a king christen
could be better bit than I have been since the first cock.
#LBSFORGOLDI’ll be damned if it isn’t 4 A.M. already. The Big Dipper has already risen above the chimney, and our horses aren’t ready yet. Hey, ostler!ostler = horse attendant at an innostler!

(offstage) Just a second!Hey, TomTom may be the name of either the ostler or the Second Carrier.Tom, give the saddle of my horse, Cut, a few whacks to soften it up, and stuff some wool under it—the old nag’s got some bad bruises on her shoulders.The feed here’s as damp as anything. That’s a fast way for a horse to get parasites. This stable’s upside down since Ostler Robin died.Poor guy. Once the price of oats went up, he was never happy again. It killed him.This stable’s got worse fleas than any in London. I’m stung like a tenchA tench is a type of fish with markings that look like flea-bites.tench.Like a tench? I’m telling you, not even a king could be bitten more than I’ve been bitten since midnight.
