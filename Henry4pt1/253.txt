Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.—Ill-spirited Worcester, did not we send grace,Pardon, and terms of love to all of you?And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary,Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman’s trust?Three knights upon our party slain today,A noble earl, and many a creature elseHad been alive this hour,If like a Christian thou hadst truly borneBetwixt our armies true intelligence.What I have done my safety urged me to.And I embrace this fortune patiently,Since not to be avoided it falls on me.Bear Worcester to the death, and Vernon too.Other offenders we will pause upon.How goes the field?The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he sawThe fortune of the day quite turned from him,The noble Percy slain, and all his menUpon the foot of fear, fled with the rest,And, falling from a hill, he was so bruisedThat the pursuers took him. At my tentThe Douglas is, and I beseech your GraceI may dispose of him.#LBSFORGOLDThis is how rebellions always end—defeated. Evil-spirited Worcester! Didn’t I offer kindness, forgiveness and friendship to all of you? And you pretended that I did the opposite? Your relatives and friends trusted you, yet you lied to them? Three of our knights who were killed today, a noble earl, and many other men might have been alive right now if you had been a decent man and reported truthfully on the negotiations between our two armies.I did what I had to do for the sake of my own well-being. I accept my fate patiently, since there’s no way I can avoid it.Put Worcester to death, and Vernon too: I’ll wait a while before I decide what to do about the others.What’s happening on the battlefield?When that brave Scotsman, Lord Douglas, saw that things were turning against him, that Percy had been killed, and that his men were fleeing in terror, he ran away too. He fell down a hill and was so badly injured that our men were able to capture him. He’s being held prisoner at my tent.I ask your highness to let me decide what to do with him.
