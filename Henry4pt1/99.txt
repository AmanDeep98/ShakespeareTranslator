All? I know not what you call all, but if I fought not with fifty
of them I am a bunch of radish. If there were not two- or
hree-and-fifty upon poor old Jack, then am I no two-legged
creature.
Pray God you have not murdered some of them.Nay, that’s past praying for. I have peppered two of them.
Two I am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits. I tell
thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me
horse. Thou knowest my old ward. Here I lay, and thus I bore
my point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me.
What, four? Thou saidst but two even now.Four, Hal, I told thee four.Ay, ay, he said four.These four came all afront, and mainly thrust at me. I made
me no more ado, but took all their seven points in my target,
thus.
Seven? Why there were but four even now.In buckram?Ay, four in buckram suits.Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.
(aside to POINS ) Prithee, let him alone. We shall have more
anon.
#LBSFORGOLDAll? I don’t know what you mean by “all.” But if I didn’t fight with fifty of them, I’m a bunch of radishes. If fifty-two or fifty-three of them didn’t attack me, then I’m no man.I pray to God you didn’t kill any of them.Too late for praying now. I made things hot for two of them; two I’m sure I got, two thugs wearing clothes made of buckram cloth. I’ll tell you what, Hal: if I’m lying to you, spit in my face and call me a horse. You know my old fighting stance. Here’s how I stood, and here’s how I handled my sword. Four thugs in buckram came right at me—What? Four? You said two a second ago.Four, Hal. I said four.That’s right. He said four.These four threw everything they had right at me. I made no big fuss of it; I just put up my shield and all seven of their swords hit it.Seven? But just now there were only four.Wearing buckram?Yes. Four in clothes made of buckram.Seven, I swear on my sword. If not, I’m a liar.
(to POINS , so no one else can hear) Leave him alone. There’ll be more in a minute.
