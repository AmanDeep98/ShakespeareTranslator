Zounds, how has he the leisure to be sickIn such a justling time? Who leads his power?Under whose government come they along?His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth,And, at the time of my departure thence,He was much feared by his physicians.I would the state of time had first been wholeEre he by sickness had been visited.His health was never better worth than now.Sick now? Droop now? This sickness doth infectThe very lifeblood of our enterprise.'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.He writes me here that inward sickness—And that his friends by deputationCould not so soon be drawn, nor did he think it meetTo lay so dangerous and dear a trustOn any soul removed but on his own;Yet doth he give us bold advertisementThat with our small conjunction we should onTo see how fortune is disposed to us,For, as he writes, there is no quailing now,Because the King is certainly possessedOf all our purposes. What say you to it?Your father’s sickness is a maim to us.A perilous gash, a very limb lopped off!And yet, in faith, it is not. His present wantSeems more than we shall find it. Were it goodTo set the exact wealth of all our statesAll at one cast? To set so rich a mainOn the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?It were not good, for therein should we readThe very bottom and the soul of hope,The very list, the very utmost boundOf all our fortunes.#LBSFORGOLDDamn! How can he take the leisure of being sick at such a frantic time? Who’s in charge of his army? Who’s leading them here?His letters will tell you his plans, my lord, not I.Pardon me, but is he bedridden?He had been, sir, for four days before I left. And on the day I left, his doctors were extremely concerned.I wish he’d waited till things were settled before he went and got sick. We’ve never needed him more than now.Sick now? Faint now? His disease is infecting our entire project. It’s spread all the way to here, right to our camp. He writes that some internal illness—and that his allies couldn’t be gathered so quickly by one of his deputies. Besides, he didn’t think it was appropriate to delegate such a dangerous and important task to someone other than himself. But he also says that we should be bold and press on with our small contingent. For, as he writes, there’s no turning back now, since the King surely knows our plans. What do you think?Your father’s sickness is a serious injury to us.It’s a perilous wound, like losing a limb. And yet, truly, it’s not that bad; the loss of my father seems worse than it is. After all, is it a good idea to bet all our resources on one throw of the dice? Or to gamble such a rich stake on a single hazardous event? No, because that would mean we had reached the end of our hope, and the very limit of our luck.
