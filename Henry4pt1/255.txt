Go to Douglas and set him free, with no ransom due. Let him do whatever he wants. His brave fighting against us today should be valued, even though he was our enemy.Thank you for giving me this honor. I’ll take care of it immediately.All that’s left is for us to split up our armies. You, my son John, and you, Westmoreland, head towards York as quickly as you can. Confront Northumberland and that churchman the Archbishop, who, I gather, are raising armies against us. You and I, Harry my son, will head for Wales to fight Glendower and Mortimer. The rebellion in this land will break apart once it meets battles like the one we fought today. And since we have accomplished our business so well, let’s not quit until everything has been won.
