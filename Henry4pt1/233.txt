What is thy name that in the battle thusThou crossest me? What honor dost thou seekUpon my head?Know then, my name is Douglas,And I do haunt thee in the battle thusBecause some tell me that thou art a king.They tell thee true.The Lord of Stafford dear today hath boughtThy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,This sword hath ended him. So shall it thee,Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot,And thou shalt find a king that will revengeLord Stafford’s death.O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,I never had triumphed upon a Scot.All’s done, all’s won; here breathless lies the King.#LBSFORGOLDWhat is your name—you, who are attacking me like this? What honor do you think you’ll get by fighting me?My name is Douglas, and I’m haunting you in this battle because they tell me you are a king.They tell you the truth.Today, Lord Stafford paid for resembling you so well, for instead of you, King Harry, my sword killed him. Now it will kill you, unless you surrender as my prisoner.I was not born to surrender, you arrogant Scotsman. You’re about to see a king take revenge for Stafford’s death.Oh, Douglas! If you’d fought like this at Holmedon, I would never have been able to beat you.It’s over, we’ve won: here’s the King, dead.
