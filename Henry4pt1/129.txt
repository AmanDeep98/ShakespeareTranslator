These promises are fair, the parties sure,And our induction full of prosperous hope.Lord Mortimer and cousin Glendower,Will you sit down? And Uncle Worcester—A plague upon it, I have forgot the map.No, here it is. Sit, cousin PercySit, good cousin Hotspur, for by that nameAs oft as Lancaster doth speak of youHis cheek looks pale and with a rising sighHe wisheth you in heaven.   And you in hell,As oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.I cannot blame him. At my nativityThe front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,Of burning cressets, and at my birthThe frame and huge foundation of the earthShaked like a coward.   Why, so it would have doneAt the same season if your mother’s catHad but kittened, though yourself had never been born.I say the earth did shake when I was born.#LBSFORGOLDThese commitments are reliable, our allies are solid, and the beginning of our project bodes well.Lord Mortimer, and kinsman Glendower, won’t you please sit? And Uncle Worcester—Dammit! I forgot the map!Here it is. Sit, kinsman Percy. Sit, good cousin Hotspur. For that is the name King Henry calls you, and whenever he says it, he grows pale, and with a sigh he wishes you were in heaven.And you in hell, whenever he hears someone say “Owen Glendower.”I don’t blame him. The sky was full of fiery meteors and comets when I was conceived, and when I was born, the entire earth shook like a coward.Why, the same thing would have happened if your mother’s cat had given birth to kittens that day, whether you’d been born or not.I say there was an earthquake when I was born.
