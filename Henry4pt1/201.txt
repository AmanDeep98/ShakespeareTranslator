We’ll fight with him tonight.   It may not be.You give him then advantage.   Not a whit.Why say you so? Looks he not for supply?So do we.His is certain; ours is doubtful.Good cousin, be advised. Stir not tonight.
(to HOTSPUR
) Do not, my lord.   You do not counsel well.You speak it out of fear and cold heart.Do me no slander, Douglas. By my life(And I dare well maintain it with my life),If well-respected honor bid me on,I hold as little counsel with weak fearAs you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives.Let it be seen tomorrow in the battleWhich of us fears.   Yea, or tonight.#LBSFORGOLDWe’ll fight him tonight.We can’t do that.Then you’re giving him the advantage.Not in the least.Why do you say that? Doesn’t he have backup coming?So do we.His is guaranteed. Ours isn’t.Nephew, I’m telling you. Don’t start the fighting tonight.
(to HOTSPUR ) Don’t, my lord.You’re giving poor advice, based on fear and cowardice.Don’t slander me, Douglas. I swear on my life—and I’ll prove it with my life—that if I’m roused to fight through thoughtful, careful consideration, I’m just as unafraid as you, my lord, or any Scotsman alive. In tomorrow’s battle, we’ll see which one of us is afraid.Fine. Or tonight.
