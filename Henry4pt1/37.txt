Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.An if the devil come and roar for them,I will not send them. I will after straightAnd tell him so, for I will ease my heart,Albeit I make a hazard of my head.What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile.Here comes your uncle.   Speak of Mortimer?Zounds, I will speak of him, and let my soulWant mercy if I do not join with him.Yea, on his part I’ll empty all these veinsAnd shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,But I will lift the downtrod MortimerAs high in the air as this unthankful King,As this ingrate and cankered Bolingbroke.
(to WORCESTER) Brother, the King hath made your nephew
mad.
Who struck this heat up after I was gone?He will forsooth have all my prisoners,And when I urged the ransom once againOf my wife’s brother, then his cheek looked pale,And on my face he turned an eye of death,Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.#LBSFORGOLDSend your prisoners, or you’ll hear about it.Even if the devil himself comes screaming for them, I won’t send those prisoners. I’m going to go after him and tell him so; it will ease my heart, though it might cost me my head.What, drunk with anger? Wait a minute. Here comes your uncle.Talk about Mortimer? God damn, I will talk about him. And damn my soul if I don’t join him! I’ll empty out my veins for him, and I’ll pour my precious blood onto the ground, drop by drop! And I’ll lift this put-upon Mortimer as high up as this ungrateful King, this ungenerous, rotten Bolingbroke!

) Brother, the King’s driven your nephew crazy.Who started this trouble after I left?He wants all my prisoners, for God’s sake! And when I asked again for him to ransom my brother-in-law, he looked pale, and he shot me a look that could kill. Just the mention of Mortimer’s name makes him shake.
