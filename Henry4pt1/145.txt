Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.O, I am ignorance itself in this!She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you downAnd rest your gentle head upon her lap,And she will sing the song that pleaseth youAnd on your eyelids crown the god of sleep,Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,Making such difference ’twixt wake and sleepAs is the difference betwixt day and nightThe hour before the heavenly harnessed teamBegins his golden progress in the east.With all my heart I’ll sit and hear her sing.By that time will our book, I think, be drawnDo so and those musicians that shall play to youHang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,And straight they shall be here. Sit, and attend.Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down.Come, quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.Go, you giddy goose.#LBSFORGOLDNo, if you start to cry, you’ll drive her mad.Oh, I have no idea what she’s saying!She wants you to lie down on the rush-covered floor and rest your head in her lap. She’ll sing whatever song you like, and she’ll lull you to sleep. She’ll bewitch you into a pleasant heaviness, halfway between waking and sleeping; like the hour just before the sun begins its golden rise in the east.I’ll gladly sit and hear her sing. By the time she’s done, I think our documents will be prepared.Do so. The musicians who are going to play are now floating in the air a thousand leagues from here. They’ll be here shortly; so sit, and listen.Kate! You’re good at lying down. Come quickly, so that I can put my head in your lapHotspur puns on the slang meanings for “head” (“penis”) and “lap” (“vagina”).head in your lap.Stop it, you silly goose.
