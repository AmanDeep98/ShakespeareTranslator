Well said, my noble Scot. If speaking truthIn this fine age were not thought flattery,Such attribution should the Douglas haveAs not a soldier of this season’s stampShould go so general current through the world.By God, I cannot flatter. I do defyThe tongues of soothers. But a braver placeIn my heart’s love hath no man than yourself.Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.Thou art the king of honor.No man so potent breathes upon the groundBut I will beard him.   Do so, and ’tis well.What letters hast thou there? (to DOUGLAS) I can but thank you.These letters come from your father.Letters from him! Why comes he not himself?He cannot come, my lord. He is grievous sick.#LBSFORGOLDWell said, you excellent Scotsman. If people these days didn’t confuse the truth with flattery, I would praise you highly. No other soldier so newly tested in battle would have gained such a widespread reputation. God knows, I don’t flatter: I hate people who give out praise too easily. But you have a place in my heart that no other man has. Make me prove it; try me.You are the most honorable man alive, and if any man challenges that—no matter how powerful—I’ll defy him.You do that. Well done.What letters have you got there? (to DOUGLAS ) All I can do is thank you.These letters come from your father.Letters from him? Why isn’t he here in person?He can’t come, my lord; he’s terribly sick.
