Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge,For on their answer will we set on them,And God befriend us as our cause is just.Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me, so;’tis a point of friendship.Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.Say thy prayers, and farewell.I would ’twere bedtime, Hal, and all well.Why, thou owest God a death.'Tis not due yet. I would be loath to pay Him before His day.
What need I be so forward with Him that calls not on me?
Well, ’tis no matter. Honour pricks me on. Yea, but how if
honor prick me off when I come on? How then? Can honor
set to a leg? no. Or an arm? no. Or take away the grief of a
wound? No. Honor hath no skill in surgery, then? No. What
is honor? A word. What is in that word “honor”? What is that
“honor”? Air. A trim reckoning. Who hath it? He that died
o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? No. Doth he hear it? No. 'Tis
insensible, then? Yea, to the dead. But will it not live with the
living? No. Why? Detraction will not suffer it. Therefore,

Say your prayers, and farewell.I wish it were bedtime, Hal, and everything were okay.But you owe God a death.It’s not due yet. I’d hate to pay him before the due date. Why should I be so eager to pay him before he even asks for it? Well, it doesn’t matter: honor spurs me on. Yeah, but what if honor spurs me off once I’m on, and picks me out to die? What happens then? Can honor set a broken leg? No. Or an arm? No. Can it make a wound stop hurting? No. Honor can’t perform surgery, then? No. What is honor? A word. What is in that word, “honor?” What is that “honor?” Air. Quite a bargain! Who has it? A guy who died last Wednesday. Does he feel it? No. Does he hear it? No. It can’t be detected, then? Right—not by the dead, anyway. But won’t it live with the living? No. Why? Slander won’t allow it. That’s why I don’t want any part of it. Honor is nothing more than a gravestone, and that concludes my catechismcatechism = a series of questions and answers that tests students’ understanding of Christian principlescatechism.
