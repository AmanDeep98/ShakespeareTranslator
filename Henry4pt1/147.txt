Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh,And ’tis no marvel he is so humorous.By 'r Lady, he is a good musician.Then should you be nothing but musical, for you are
altogether governed by humors. Lie still, you thief, and hear
the lady sing in Welsh.
I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.Wouldst thou have thy head broken?No.Then be still.Neither;’tis a woman’s fault.Now God help thee!To the Welsh lady’s bed.What’s that?Peace, she sings.Come, Kate, I’ll have your song too.Not mine, in good sooth.#LBSFORGOLDNow I see that the devil understands Welsh; it’s no surprise he’s so moody. By God, he’s a good musician.Then you should be incredibly musical, for you’re the moodiest man alive. Lie still, you thief. Listen to the lady sing in Welsh.I’d rather hear Lady, my dog, howl in Irish.Do you want your head broken in?No.Then be still.Never; that’s a womanly trait.Now God help you—Into the Welsh lady’s bed!What did you say?Quiet! She’s singing.Come on, Kate. I want to hear your song, too.Not mine, darn it.
