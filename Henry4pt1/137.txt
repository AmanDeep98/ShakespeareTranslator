Yea, but Mark how he bears his course, and runs me upWith like advantage on the other side,Gelding the opposèd continent as muchAs on the other side it takes from you.Yea, but a little charge will trench him hereAnd on this north side win this cape of land,And then he runs straight and even.I’ll have it so. A little charge will do it.I’ll not have it altered.   Will not you?No, nor you shall not.   Who shall say me nay?Why, that will I.Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.I can speak English, lord, as well as you,For I was trained up in the English court,Where being but young I framèd to the harpMany an English ditty lovely wellAnd gave the tongue a helpful ornament—A virtue that was never seen in you.Marry,And I am glad of it with all my heart:I had rather be a kitten and cry “mew”Than one of these same meter balladmongers.#LBSFORGOLDYes, but look how the Trent runs its course and winds a similar distance into my share. It cuts out the same amount of land from my side as it does from yours.Yes, but a small sum of money will pay to dig a trench, which will reclaim this bit of land on the north side. Then it will run straight along.I’ll do that. It will only take a little money.I won’t have it changed.You won’t?No, and neither will you.Who’s going to stop me?Why, I will.Well, say it in Welsh then, so I can’t understand you.My lord, I can speak English just as well as you. I was brought up in the English court. There, in my youth, I composed many English songs for the harp, lending the language lovely ornaments of music. That is an accomplishment you have never achieved.Indeed, and my whole heart is glad for that. I’d rather be a kitten and say “meow” than be a courtly balladeer.
