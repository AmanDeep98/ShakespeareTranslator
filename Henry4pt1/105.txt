Come, let’s hear, Jack. What trick hast thou now?By the Lord, I knew you as well as he that made you. Why,
hear you, my masters, was it for me to kill the heir apparent?
Should I turn upon the true Prince? Why, thou knowest I am
as valiant as Hercules, but beware instinct. The lion will not
touch the true Prince. Instinct is a great matter. I was now a
coward on instinct. I shall think the better of myself, and
thee, during my life—I for a valiant lion, and thou for a true
Prince. But, by the Lord, lads, I am glad you have the
money.—Hostess, clap to the doors.— Watch tonight, pray
to-morrow. Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles
of good fellowship come to you. What, shall we be merry?
hall we have a play extempore?
Content, and the argument shall be thy running away.Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me.O Jesu, my lord the Prince!How now, my lady the hostess, what sayest thou to me?#LBSFORGOLDCome on, let’s hear it, Jack. What trick have you got now?By God, I knew it was you the whole time, like I was your own father! Listen to me, men: would it be right for me to kill the heir-apparent? Should I have attacked the true Prince? Look, you know I’m as brave as HerculesHercules was a Greek hero renowned for his bravery.Hercules, but you must listen to your instinct. It’s like that old superstition, about how a lion will never attack a true Prince. Instinct is a powerful thing; I was only a coward by instinct. From now on, I’ll have to think of myself as a brave lion, and you as a true Prince. But good God, men, I’m glad you have the money. Hostess! Lock the doors; we’ll celebrate tonight and pray tomorrow. Gentlemen, lads, boys, hearts of gold—I’ll call you every good name I can think of, all at once! Hey! Shall we have some fun? Shall we stage a little play?Of course, and the play will be about you running away.Oh, let it go, Hal, if you love me.Oh, Jesus—Your Majesty!Hello there, my lady the hostess! Do you have something to say to me?
