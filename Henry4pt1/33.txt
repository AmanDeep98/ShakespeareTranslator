Of guns, and drums, and wounds—God save the mark!—And telling me the sovereignest thing on earthWas parmacety for an inward bruise,And that it was great pity, so it was,This villanous saltpeter should be diggedOut of the bowels of the harmless earth,Which many a good tall fellow had destroyedSo cowardly, and but for these vile gunsHe would himself have been a soldier.This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,I answered indirectly, as I said,And I beseech you, let not his reportCome current for an accusationBetwixt my love and your high Majesty.The circumstance considered, good my lord,Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had saidTo such a person and in such a place,At such a time, with all the rest retold,May reasonably die and never riseTo do him wrong or any way impeachWhat then he said, so he unsay it now.Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,But with proviso and exceptionThat we at our own charge shall ransom straightHis brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer,Who, on my soul, hath willfully betrayedThe lives of those that he did lead to fightAgainst that great magician, damned Glendower,Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of MarchHath lately married. Shall our coffers thenBe emptied to redeem a traitor home?Shall we buy treason and indent with fearsWhen they have lost and forfeited themselves?No, on the barren mountains let him starve,For I shall never hold that man my friendWhose tongue shall ask me for one penny costTo ransom home revolted Mortimer.#LBSFORGOLDI was so angry, looking at him all shiny and sweet-smelling, and speaking like a squeamish woman about guns and battle drums and wounds—God almighty! —and telling me the best thing for an injury is parmacetiparmaceti = spermaceti, a medicinal ointment derived from fat taken from a sperm whale’s headparmaceti, and that it was a shame that the blameless earth had to be dug up to find saltpeter for the gunpowder, when so many good, brave men had been cowardly destroyed by guns, and that if it hadn’t been for those disgusting guns, he would have been a soldier himself. All this trivial, incoherent talk I answered offhandedly, as I’ve already told you. So I beg you: please don’t take his word as evidence that there’s anything wrong between you and me, your Majesty.Given the circumstances, my lord, whatever Harry Percy may have said to a man like that, in a place and time like that, should be allowed to die and never be spoken of again. It should never be used against Harry in any way, since he has taken it all back now.But he still won’t turn over his prisoners unless he can add these stipulations and exceptions. He wants me, at my own cost, to pay ransom for his brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer, a man who, on my life, willfully betrayed his own men, whom he had led in fighting against that great magician, the damned Glendower. And now we hear that Mortimer has married Glendower’s daughter! Should the treasury be emptied to ransom a traitor? Should I pay for treason, and bargain for a coward, when it was Mortimer who lost himself? No. Let him starve in the wilderness. No man who asks me to spend one penny on that traitor Mortimer can ever be a friend of mine.
