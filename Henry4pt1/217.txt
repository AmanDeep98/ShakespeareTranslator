Hear me, my liege:For mine own part I could be well contentTo entertain the lag end of my lifeWith quiet hours. For I do protestI have not sought the day of this dislike.You have not sought it. How comes it then?Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.Peace, chewet, peace.
(to the KING) It pleased your Majesty to turn your looksOf favour from myself and all our house;And yet I must remember you, my lord,We were the first and dearest of your friends.For you my staff of office did I breakIn Richard’s time, and posted day and nightTo meet you on the way, and kiss your handWhen yet you were in place and in accountNothing so strong and fortunate as I.It was myself, my brother, and his sonThat brought you home and boldly did outdareThe dangers of the time.
