Cheerly, my lord. How fares your Grace?Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,And so hath Clifton. I’ll to Clifton straight.Stay, and breathe awhile.Thou hast redeemed thy lost opinionAnd showed thou mak’st some tender of my lifeIn this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.O God, they did me too much injuryThat ever said I hearkened for your death.If it were so, I might have let aloneThe insulting hand of Douglas over you,Which would have been as speedy in your endAs all the poisonous potions in the world,And saved the treacherous labor of your son.Make up to Clifton. I’ll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.Thou speak’st as if I would deny my name.My name is Harry Percy.   Why, then I seeA very valiant rebel of the name.I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,To share with me in glory any more.Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere,Nor can one England brook a double reign,Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.#LBSFORGOLDCheer up, father. How are you? Sir Nicholas Gawsey called for reinforcements, and so has Clifton. I’m going to Clifton right now.Wait, and breathe for a moment. You have redeemed your bad reputation, and show that you care something for me, by rescuing me like this.Oh God! Anyone who ever said I wished for you to die did me a terrible wrong. If I wanted that, I would have let Douglas continue his attack. That would have killed you faster than any dose of poison, and it would have saved me the trouble of treachery.Go to Clifton; I’ll go to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.If I’m not mistaken, you’re Harry Monmouth.You make it sound as if I’d deny it.My name is Harry Percy.Why then, I’m looking at a very brave rebel by that name. I am the Prince of Wales, and don’t think, Percy, that you can share in my glory any longer. There isn’t enough room for two stars in the same orbit; England cannot handle a double reign, Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales ruling at once.
