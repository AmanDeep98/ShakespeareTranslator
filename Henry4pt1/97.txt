Where is it? Taken from us it is. A hundred upon poor four
of us.
What, a hundred, man?I am a rogue if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them
two hours together. I have ’scaped by miracle. I am eight
times thrust through the doublet, four through the hose, my
buckler cut through and through, my sword hacked like
a handsaw. Ecce signum! I never dealt better since I was a
man. All would not do. A plague of all cowards! (points to
							
GADSHILL, PETO and BARDOLPH ) Let them speak. If they speak
more or less than truth, they are villains, and the sons of
darkness.
Speak, sirs, how was it?We four set upon some dozen.Sixteen at least, my lord.And bound them.No, no, they were not bound.You rogue, they were bound, every man of them, or I am aJew else, an Ebrew Jew.As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set
upon us.
And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.What, fought you with them all?#LBSFORGOLDWhere is it? It was stolen from us. A hundred men against only four of us.What, a hundred, man?I’ll be damned if I didn’t fight with a dozen of them for two straight hours. It’s a miracle I managed to get away. They stabbed through my shirt eight times. Four through my pants. My shield’s got holes through and through. My sword’s as cut up as a hacksaw. Behold the evidence! It was the best fighting I’ve ever done, but even my all wasn’t enough. A curse on all cowards! (points to GADSHILL, PETO and BARDOLPH) Ask these men. If they don’t tell you the whole truth, they’re liars and devils.Tell us, men. What happened?The four of us jumped about a dozen—Sixteen at least, my lord.And tied them up.No, no. We didn’t tie them up.You jerk, we did tie them up, every single one of them, or I’m a Jew, a true Hebrew Jew.Then, when we were dividing the money, about six or seven other men jumped us—And untied the rest, and then all the others showed up.What, you fought with all of them?
