Nor shall it, Harry, for the hour is comeTo end the one of us, and would to GodThy name in arms were now as great as mine.I’ll make it greater ere I part from thee,And all the budding honors on thy crestI’ll crop, to make a garland for my head.I can no longer brook thy vanities.Well said, Hal! To it Hal! Nay, you shall find no boys' play
here, I can tell you.
O Harry, thou hast robbed me of my youth.I better brook the loss of brittle lifeThan those proud titles thou hast won of me.They wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh.But thoughts, the slave of life, and life, time’s fool,And time, that takes survey of all the world,Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,But that the earthy and cold hand of deathLies on my tongue. No, Percy, thou art dust,And food for— (he dies)
#LBSFORGOLDIt won’t have to, Harry, for the time has come for one of us to die. I only wish that you had as great a reputation in warfare as I do.My reputation will be greater by the time we part. I’ll take all the flowers of honor from your helmet, and turn them into a garland for myself.I can’t stand your arrogance any longer.Well said, Hal! Go for it, Hal! This isn’t child’s play, I’ll tell you that much!Oh, Harry, you’ve taken awayembowelled = disemboweled, in order to be embalmedtaken away my youth. I can handle the loss of my fragile life, but not the loss of all the honors you have won from me: that loss wounds my thoughts more than your sword wounds my flesh. But thought depends on life, and life depends on time, and time, which watches over the whole world, must stop eventually. Oh, I could make prophecies, but the cold hand of death is stopping my tongue. No, Percy. You are dust, and food for—(he dies)
