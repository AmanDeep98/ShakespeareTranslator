Not yours, in good sooth! Heart, you swear like a
								comfit-maker’s wife! “Not you, in good sooth,” and “as true as I
								live,” and “as God shall mend me,” and “as sure as day”—And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oathsAs if thou never walk’st further than Finsbury.Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,A good mouth-filling oath, and leave “in sooth,”And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,To velvet-guards and Sunday citizens.Come, sing.I will not sing.'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast teacher. An
the indentures be drawn, I’ll away within these two hours,
and so come in when ye will.
Come, come, Lord Mortimer; you are as slowAs hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.By this our book is drawn. We’ll but seal,And then to horse immediately.   With all my heart.#LBSFORGOLDNot yours? Darn it? Honestly! You swear like a candymaker’s wife. “Not you, darn it.” And “I swear on my life,” and “God forgive me,” and “as plain as day.” Your curse words are smooth as silk. You’d think you’d never gone further than Finsbury in your life. Swear like the real lady you are, Kate. Let loose a good mouthful of curses; leave “darn” and such watered-down cursewords to those citizens, trimmed in velvet and wearing their Sunday best. Come on, sing.I will not sing.It’s the quickest way to become a tailor; tailors love to sing. Or you could teach songs to birds. If our agreements are drawn up, I’ll be gone within two hours; come find me whenever you want.Come now, Mortimer. You’re as reluctant to leave as Percy is on fire to go. Our agreements are drawn up by now. We’ll sign and then go straight to our horses.I go with all my heart.
