The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou
and I rob the thieves and go merrily to London, it would be
argument for a week, laughter for a month, and a good jest
forever.
Stand close, I hear them coming.Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse before day.
An the Prince and Poins be not two arrant cowards, there’s
no equity stirring. There’s no more valor in that Poins than
in a wild duck.
Your money!Villains!Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse.The thieves are all scattered, and possessed with fearSo strongly that they dare not meet each other.Each takes his fellow for an officer.Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death,And lards the lean earth as he walks along.Were ’t not for laughing, I should pity him.#LBSFORGOLDThe thieves have tied up the honest men. If you and I can now rob the robbers and run laughing to London, we would talk about it for a week, laugh about it for a month, and it would be a hilarious story forever.Get down. I hear them coming.Come on, boys, let’s divide up the spoils and then ride off before dawn. If the Prince and Poins aren’t cowards, there’s no justice in the universe. Poins is about as brave as a duck.
(in disguise) Give us your money!
(in disguise) Crooks!Too easy. Now we ride off happily. The thieves have scattered, and they’re so terrified that they don’t even want to run into each other—they’ll each think that the other guy is an officer! Let’s go, Ned. Falstaff is sweating so hard that he’s watering the ground as he walks along. If I weren’t laughing so hard, I’d actually feel sorry for him.
