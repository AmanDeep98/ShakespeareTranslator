I saw him hold Lord Percy at the pointWith lustier maintenance than I did look forOf such an ungrown warrior.O, this boy lends mettle to us all.Another king! they grow like Hydra’s heads.—I am the Douglas, fatal to all thoseThat wear those colors on them. What art thouThat counterfeit’st the person of a king?The King himself, who, Douglas, grieves at heart,So many of his shadows thou hast metAnd not the very king. I have two boysSeek Percy and thyself about the field,But, seeing thou fall’st on me so luckily,I will assay thee. And defend thyself.I fear thou art another counterfeit,And yet, in faith, thou bear’st thee like a king.But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,And thus I win thee.Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art likeNever to hold it up again. The spiritsOf valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt are in my arms.It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee,Who never promiseth but he means to pay.#LBSFORGOLDHe had Percy cornered, and he carried himself more bravely than I would have expected of such a young warrior.Oh, this boy lends us all courage!Another king! The more of them we kill, the more of them spring up. I am Douglas, and I bring death to everyone wearing that uniform. Who are you, disguised as a king?The King himself. And it pains me, Douglas, that you ran into so many of my shadows, and not me. I have two sons on the field, looking for Percy and for you. But, since you were lucky enough to come upon me, I’ll fight you myself. Defend yourself.I fear that you’re another fake; and yet, you bear yourself like a king. Whoever you are, you’re mine, and I’ll defeat you.Look at me, you nasty Scotsman, or you’ll never look at anything again. I have the spirits of brave Shirley, Stafford, and Blunt in me. It is the Prince of Wales who threatens you, and I never make promises I cannot keep.
