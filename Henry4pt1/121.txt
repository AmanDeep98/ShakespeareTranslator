I do, I will.O, my lord, my lord, the Sheriff with a most monstrous
watch is at the door.
Out, you rogue.—Play out the play. I have much to say in the
behalf of that Falstaff.
O Jesu, my lord, my lord—Heigh, heigh, the devil rides upon a fiddlestick. What’s the
matter?
The Sheriff and all the watch are at the door. They are come
to search the house. Shall I let them in?
Dost thou hear, Hal? Never call a true piece of gold a
counterfeit. Thou art essentially made, without seeming so.
#LBSFORGOLDI do. I will.Oh sir, sir! The Sheriff and a frightening group of officers are at the door.Wait, you ass! We’ll finish the play: I have much to say on behalf of that Falstaff.Jesus! Sir, sir!Well, look here! All this mess over nothing! What’s the matter?The Sheriff and the officers are at the door. They’ve come to search the place. Should I let them in?Do you hear that, Hal?This line is ambiguous; Falstaff may be saying that, though he seems to be a scoundrel, he is a really a good man, and therefore should not be turned over to the watch.Hal? Be careful about calling a piece of real gold a counterfeit; you are genuine, even though it may not seem so.
