Whew!A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you rogues. Give
me my horse and be hanged!
Peace, you fat guts! Lie down, lay thine ear close to the
ground, and list if thou canst hear the tread of travelers.
Have you any levers to lift me up again being down?
'Sblood, I’ll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot again for
all the coin in thy father’s Exchequer. What a plague mean
you to colt me thus?
Thou liest. Thou art not colted; thou art uncolted.I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse, good king’s
son.
Out, you rogue! Shall I be your ostler?Hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent garters! If I be ta'en,
I’ll peach for this. An I have not ballads made on you all and
sung to filthy tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison—when
a jest is so forward, and afoot too! I hate it.
#LBSFORGOLDWhew!The hell with you all! Give me my horse, you deadbeats. Give me my horse and the hell with you!Shut up, fatso! Lie down, put your ear to the ground, and listen for the footsteps of travelers.Do you have a crane to lift me up again once I’m down? Damn, I wouldn’t walk my fat self this far again for all the money in your father’s treasury. What are you doing horsing around with me like this?You’re lying. We can’t horse around, because you don’t have a horse.Please, my good Hal, help me find my horse, you good king’s son.Later with that! You want me to be your stable boy?Go drop dead in your own heir-apparent pants. If I’m arrested, I’ll rat you out, too. If I don’t get them singing dirty songs in the street about you all, let me be poisoned to death with booze. I hate it when a practical joke gets so out of hand—and with me out of a horse, too!
