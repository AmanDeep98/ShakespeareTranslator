   You strain too far.I rather of his absence make this use:It lends a luster and more great opinion,A larger dare, to our great enterpriseThan if the Earl were here, for men must thinkIf we without his help can make a headTo push against a kingdom, with his helpWe shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.As heart can think. There is not such a wordSpoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul.Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,Is marching hitherwards, with him Prince John.No harm, what more?   And further I have learned,The King himself in person is set forth,Or hitherwards intended speedily,With strong and mighty preparation.He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,And his comrades, that daffed the world asideAnd bid it pass?#LBSFORGOLDYou’re taking this too far. I’d rather think about his absence this way: it makes us look even better. It makes our great undertaking seem even more daring than it would if Northumberland were here. People will think that if we can raise an army against the King without my father, that once he joins we’ll turn the whole kingdom upside down. Everything is fine, we’re all in one piece.We’re as well off as we could have hoped. In Scotland, we don’t even know the meaning of the word fear.Welcome, kinsman Vernon, from the bottom of my heart.I pray to God that what I have to say is worth welcoming, my lord. The Earl of Westmoreland, with seven thousand men, is marching this way. Prince John is with him.Nothing to be worried about. What else?I’ve also learned that the King himself is coming this way, or at least plans to very soon, with a huge and powerful force.We’ll welcome him too. Where’s his son, that sporting, foolhardy Prince of Wales, and his comrades, who don’t care about anything?
