This is his uncle’s teaching. This is Worcester,Malevolent to you in all aspects,Which makes him prune himself, and bristle upThe crest of youth against your dignity.But I have sent for him to answer this.And for this cause awhile we must neglectOur holy purpose to Jerusalem.Cousin, on Wednesday next our council weWill hold at Windsor. So inform the lords.But come yourself with speed to us again,For more is to be said and to be doneThan out of anger can be utterèd.I will, my liege.#LBSFORGOLDHis uncle Worcester put him up to that. It is just like Worcester to act against you in all ways. He’s the one making Hotspur behave like this, flaunting his youth in the face of your dignified age.I’ve sent for Hotspur to explain himself. We’ll have to postpone the plans for our crusade to Jerusalem. Go tell my advisers that our next meeting will be Wednesday at Windsor. Then hurry back here. There’s more to be said and done, but I’m too angry now to speak.I will, my lord.
