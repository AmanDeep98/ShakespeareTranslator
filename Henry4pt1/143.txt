This is the deadly spite that angers me:My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.My daughter weeps; she’ll not part with you.She’ll be a soldier too, she’ll to the wars.Good father, tell her that she and my aunt PercyShall follow in your conduct speedily.She is desperate here, a peevish self-willed harlotry,One that no persuasion can do good upon.I understand thy looks. That pretty WelshWhich thou pourest down from these swelling heavensI am too perfect in, and but for shameIn such a parley should I answer thee.I understand thy kisses and thou mine,And that’s a feeling disputation;But I will never be a truant, love,Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongueMakes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penned,Sung by a fair queen in a summer’s bower,With ravishing division, to her lute.#LBSFORGOLDThis is the bad luck that angers me: my wife speaks no English, and I speak no Welsh.My daughter is weeping: she doesn’t want to be parted from you. She wants to be a soldier and join you in the war.Father-in-law, tell her that she and Lady Percy will come with you after us.She’s desperate now; a cranky, selfish hussy. Nobody can change her mind.I understand you by the look on your face. Those pretty Welsh tears streaming from your heavenly eyes I understand perfectly; I’d answer in the same language, if it weren’t shameful for a man to cry.I understand your kisses and you mine; that’s a conversation of emotion. I’ll study continuously, my love, until I learn your language. Your voice makes Welsh sound as sweet as the most eloquently written songs, sung by a fair queen in a garden of summer flowers, with a gorgeous accompaniment on her a lute.
