Did gage them both in an unjust behalf(As both of you, God pardon it, have done)To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?And shall it in more shame be further spokenThat you are fooled, discarded, and shook offBy him for whom these shames you underwent?No, yet time serves wherein you may redeemYour banished honors and restore yourselvesInto the good thoughts of the world again,Revenge the jeering and disdain’d contemptOf this proud King, who studies day and nightTo answer all the debt he owes to youEven with the bloody payment of your deaths.Therefore I say—   Peace, cousin, say no more.And now I will unclasp a secret book,And to your quick-conceiving discontentsI’ll read you matter deep and dangerous,As full of peril and adventurous spiritAs to o'erwalk a current roaring loudOn the unsteadfast footing of a spear.If he fall in, good night, or sink or swim!Send danger from the east unto the west,So honor cross it from the north to south,And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirsTo rouse a lion than to start a hare!Imagination of some great exploitDrives him beyond the bounds of patience.By heaven, methinks it were an easy leapTo pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon,Or dive into the bottom of the deep,Where fathom line could never touch the ground,And pluck up drownèd honor by the locks,So he that doth redeem her thence might wearWithout corrival all her dignities.But out upon this half-faced fellowship!#LBSFORGOLDWhile history books record that men of your nobility and power dedicated themselves to as unjust a cause (which, God forgive you, you both did) as the overthrowing of Richard, that sweet lovely rose, and the planting of this thorn, this weed, Bolingbroke in Richard’s place? Will you listen as people say that you are fools, and that you’ve been tossed away by the very person you shamed yourselves to help? No. There is still time for you to redeem your reputations and restore your good names in the eyes of the world. Take revenge against this King who mocks and scorns you. He thinks constantly about how to repay you for all you did—by putting you to death. So I say—Quiet, nephew; don’t say any more. I have a secret for you, which is hidden like a book with a lock. I will open the book and read you a dark, dangerous story that will appeal to your righteous anger. It’s full of peril and adventure, as risky as walking across a churning, thundering river while balanced unsteadily on a spear.If he falls in, then it’s all over, whether he sinks or swims. The honor of the struggle is all that counts, no matter what the danger is or where it comes from. It takes more courage to wake a sleeping lion than to frighten a rabbit!Dreaming about this heroic exploit is driving him past his patience.By God, I think it would be easy to jump up and grab honor off of the moon’s pale face, or to dive into the deepest ocean and pull up honor by its hair.Then the man who rescues honor can wear her glory alone, without rivals. To hell with sharing the glory!
