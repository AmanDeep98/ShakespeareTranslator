Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.But, my lads, my lads, tomorrow morning, by four o'clock,
early at Gad’s Hill, there are pilgrims going to Canterbury
with rich offerings, and traders riding to London with fat
purses. I have vizards for you all. You have horses for
yourselves. Gadshill lies tonight in Rochester. I have
bespoke supper tomorrow night in Eastcheap. We may do it
as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff your purses full
of crowns. If you will not, tarry at home and be hanged.
Hear ye, Yedward, if I tarry at home and go not, I’ll hang you
for going.
You will, chops?Hal, wilt thou make one?Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.There’s neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in
thee, nor thou cam’st not of the blood royal, if thou darest not
stand for ten shillings.
Well then, once in my days I’ll be a madcap.Why, that’s well said.Well, come what will, I’ll tarry at home.By the Lord, I’ll be a traitor then when thou art king.#LBSFORGOLDHis only other choice is to be damned for cheating the devil.But boys, boys! Four o'clock tomorrow morning some pilgrims are going to pass by Gad’s Hill. They’ll be on their way to Canterbury Cathedral with expensive offerings, and traders will be heading to London with bags of money. I’ve got masks for you, you’ve got horses for yourselves. Mr. Gadshill is spending tonight in Rochester, and I’ve already ordered tomorrow night’s dinner in Eastcheap. We could do this in our sleep. If you come, I’ll make you rich. If not, stay home and hang yourselves.Listen, Yedward. If I stay home and don’t go, I’ll hang you — for going.You will, fatface?Hal, are you in?Who? Me, a robber? Me, a thief? Not me. No way.If you don’t dare to fight for ten shillings, there’s no honesty, manhood, or friendship in you, and you never came from royal blood.Well, okay. For once in my life, I’ll be a little crazy.There you go.Well, you know what? I’ll stay home.By God, then I’ll be a traitor when you become king.
