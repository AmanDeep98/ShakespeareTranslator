And so there is. But yet the King hath drawnThe special head of all the land together:The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,The noble Westmoreland, and warlike Blunt,And many more corrivals and dear menOf estimation and command in arms.Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.I hope no less, yet needful ’tis to fear;And to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed.For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the KingDismiss his power, he means to visit us,For he hath heard of our confederacy,And ’tis but wisdom to make strong against him:Therefore make haste. I must go write againTo other friends. And so farewell, Sir Michael.#LBSFORGOLDThat’s correct. But the King has pulled together the best men in the country: the Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster, the noble Westmoreland, warlike Blunt, and many other acquaintances and valuable men of good reputation, with great skill in battle.No doubt they will face great opposition.I hope so, but still I’m afraid. Now hurry, Sir Michael, to prevent an absolute disaster. For if Percy doesn’t prevail, the King will come after us before he disbands his army. He’s heard that we’re part of the rebellion, so we’d be wise to prepare against him. Now hurry. I have to go write to more friends. Farewell, Sir Michael.
