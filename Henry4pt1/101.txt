Dost thou hear me, Hal?Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine in buckram
that I told thee of—
So, two more already.Their points being broken—Down fell their hose.Began to give me ground, but I followed me close, came in
foot and hand, and with a thought, seven of the eleven I paid.
O monstrous! Eleven buckram men grown out of two!But as the devil would have it, three misbegotten knaves in
Kendal green came at my back, and let drive at me, for it was
so dark, Hal, that thou couldst not see thy hand.
These lies are like their father that begets them, gross as a
mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou claybrained guts, thou
knotty-pated fool, thou whoreson, obscene, greasy tallow-
catch—
What, art thou mad? Art thou mad? Is not the truth the truth?#LBSFORGOLDAre you listening to me, Hal?I’m listening, Jack.Good, because it’s worth paying attention to. Anyway, these nine guys in buckram that I told you about—So, two more already.Since their points were broken—Their stockingsFalstaff means points as in “swords,” but the word can also mean “stocking fasteners.”stockings fell down.They started to run away, but I followed them closely. And as quick as a thought, I finished off seven of the eleven.Unbelievable! Eleven buckram men have grown out of two!But as the devil would have it, three wretched bastards wearing green came from behind and ran right at me. It was so dark, Hal, that you couldn’t see your hand in front of your face.These lies are like the man who tells them: huge as a mountain, obvious, and plain as day. You clay-brained fatso, you knuckleheaded fool, you son of a whore, you obscene tub of lard—What are you, crazy? Are you crazy? Isn’t the truth the truth?
