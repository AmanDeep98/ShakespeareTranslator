How? The Prince is a jack, a sneak-up. 'Sblood, an he were
here, I would cudgel him like a dog if he would say so.
How now, lad, is the wind in that door, i' faith? Must we all
march?
Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.My lord, I pray you, hear me.What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy
husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.
Good my lord, hear me.Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.What say’st thou, Jack?The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras, and had
my pocket picked. This house is turned bawdy house; they
pick pockets.
What didst thou lose, Jack?Wilt thou believe me, Hal, three or four bonds of forty pound
apiece, and a seal ring of my grandfather’s.
A trifle, some eightpenny matter.#LBSFORGOLDWhat? The Prince is a bastard, a sneak. Dammit, if he were here and said something like that, I’d beat him like a dog.Hey there, lad! Is that what’s happening? Are we all going to march?Yes, side by side, like prisoners to the gallows.My lord, please, listen to me.What is it, Mistress Quickly? How’s your husband? I think highly of him; he’s an honest man.My lord, please listen to me.Forget about her, and listen to me.What is it, Jack?The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras and I had my pocket picked. This bar’s like a whorehouse: they pick your pockets.What did you lose, Jack?Would you believe it, Hal? Three or four I.O.U.’s worth forty pounds each, and my grandfather’s sealing ring.Junk, not worth more than eight pennies.
