Nay, if you have not, to it again.We will stay your leisure.   I have done, i' faith.Then once more to your Scottish prisoners:Deliver them up without their ransom straight,And make the Douglas' son your only meanFor powers in Scotland, which, for divers reasonsWhich I shall send you written, be assuredWill easily be granted.—(to
NORTHUMBERLAND) You, 
my lord,Your son in Scotland being thus employed,Shall secretly into the bosom creepOf that same noble prelate, well beloved,The Archbishop.   Of York, is it not?    True; who bears hardHis brother’s death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.I speak not this in estimation,As what I think might be, but what I knowIs ruminated, plotted, and set down,And only stays but to behold the faceOf that occasion that shall bring it on.I smell it. Upon my life, it will do well.Before the game is afoot thou still let’st slip.Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot.And then the power of Scotland and of YorkTo join with Mortimer, ha?#LBSFORGOLDNo, if you’re not done yet, keep going. We’ll wait until you’re ready.I’m done. I swear.Then go back to your Scottish prisoners. Release them at once, without ransom. Make friends with Douglas, and use his influence to gather an army in Scotland. He’ll gladly help you for many reasons, which I’ll write you about soon. (to NORTHUMBERLAND) Now you, sir. While your son is busy in Scotland, you will strike up a close alliance with the Archbishop, that noble, well-beloved churchman.He is the Archbishop of York, no?Yes, and he’s sorely upset about his brother, Lord Scroop, whom Bolingbroke put to death in Bristol. I’m not merely speculating; I’m telling you what I know for a fact has been considered, plotted, and set into motion. They’re only waiting now for the right moment to strike.I get it. And it’s good, I bet my life on it!Look, you’ve let your dogs slip off of their leashes before the hunt has even begun.There’s no way this excellent plan won’t work. And the armies of Scotland and York will join with Mortimer, right?
