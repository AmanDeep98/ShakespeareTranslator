Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?Zounds, where thou wilt, lad. I’ll make one. An I do not, call
me villain and baffle me.
I see a good amendment of life in thee, from praying to
purse-taking.
Why, Hal, ’tis my vocation, Hal. 'Tis no sin for a man to
labor in his vocation.
Poins!—Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match. O,
if men were to be saved by merit, what hole in hell were hot
enough for him? This is the most omnipotent villain that
ever cried “Stand!” to a true man.
Good morrow, Ned.Good morrow, sweet Hal.—What says Monsieur Remorse?
What says Sir John Sack-and-Sugar? Jack, how agrees the
devil and thee about thy soul that thou soldest him on Good
Friday last for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon’s leg?
Sir John stands to his word. The devil shall have his bargain,
for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs. He will give the devil his due.

(to FALSTAFF
)Then art thou damned for keeping thy word
with the devil.
#LBSFORGOLDWhere should we go stealing tomorrow, Jack?For God’s sake, wherever you want, boy. I’ll be one of the gang.

Now we’ll find out whether Mr. Gadshill has planned a robbery. If good deeds bring a man to heaven, there’s no hell hot enough for Poins. This is the most incredible villain, whoever said “Stick 'em up!” to an honest man.Morning, Ned.Morning, sweet Hal. What’s Mr. Feelbad got to say? What’s going on, Sir John, Wino Jack? How’s your deal with the devil coming along? You sold him your soul last Good Friday for some cold chicken and a glass of cheap wine, right?The devil will get what’s coming to him. Sir John’s a man of his word, and he never disagrees with a proverb. He will “give the devil his due.”
