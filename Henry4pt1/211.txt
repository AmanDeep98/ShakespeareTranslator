Hie, good Sir Michael, bear this sealèd briefWith winged haste to the Lord Marshal,This to my cousin Scroop, and all the restTo whom they are directed. If you knewHow much they do import, you would make haste.My good lord, I guess their tenor.Like enough you do.Tomorrow, good Sir Michael, is a dayWherein the fortune of ten thousand menMust bide the touch. For, sir, at Shrewsbury,As I am truly given to understand,The King with mighty and quick-raisèd powerMeets with Lord Harry. And I fear, Sir Michael,What with the sickness of Northumberland,Whose power was in the first proportion,And what with Owen Glendower’s absence thence,Who with them was a rated sinew tooAnd comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,I fear the power of Percy is too weakTo wage an instant trial with the King.Why, my good lord, you need not fear.There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.No, Mortimer is not there.But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,And there is my Lord of Worcester and a headOf gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.#LBSFORGOLDHurry, Sir Michael, bring this sealed letter as fast as you can to the Lord Marshal. Bring this one to Scroop, and all the rest to whom they are addressed. If you knew how important they were, you would hurry.My good lord, I can guess what they say.I’m sure you can. Tomorrow, Sir Michael, ten thousand men will try their luck. I’m told that at Shrewsbury, the King—with a huge and quickly assembled army—will fight Harry Percy. I’m afraid, Michael, that without Northumberland, whose army was the largest of all, and without Owen Glendower, who was also being counted on but is absent because his horoscope told him to stay away, I’m afraid that Percy’s army will be too weak to fight the King right now.Don’t worry, sir. Douglas and Mortimer are there.No, Mortimer isn’t there.But Mordake is there, and Vernon, and Harry Percy, and Worcester and a slew of brave warriors and excellent men.
