   All furnished, all in arms,All plumed like estridges that with the windBaited like eagles having lately bathed,Glittering in golden coats like images,As full of spirit as the month of May,And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer,Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.I saw young Harry with his beaver on,His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly armedRise from the ground like feathered MercuryAnd vaulted with such ease into his seatAs if an angel dropped down from the clouds,To turn and wind a fiery PegasusAnd witch the world with noble horsemanship.No more, no more! Worse than the sun in MarchThis praise doth nourish agues. Let them come.They come like sacrifices in their trim,And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky warAll hot and bleeding will we offer them.The mailèd Mars shall on his altar sitUp to the ears in blood. I am on fireTo hear this rich reprisal is so nighAnd yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,Who is to bear me like a thunderboltAgainst the bosom of the Prince of Wales.Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.O, that Glendower were come!   There is more news.I learned in Worcester, as I rode along,He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.That’s the worst tidings that I hear of yet.#LBSFORGOLDThey’re all in uniform, all armed. They look like feathered ostriches; like eagles beating their wings after a bath; like statues painted gold. They’re as lively as the springtime; as gorgeous as the midsummer sun; as giddy as young goats; as wild as young bulls. I saw young Harry with his helmet on, and armor on his thighs. Armed with powerful weapons, he rose off the ground like the winged god Mercury, and leaped so effortlessly into his saddle, it was as if an angel had dropped out of the sky to ride a fiery PegasusPegasus = a winged horse, from Greek mythologyPegasus, and bewitch the world with his incredible horsemanship.Stop, stop! This praise of him makes me sicker than the sun on an early spring day. Let them come, like sacrifices in all their finery; we’ll offer them, hot and bleeding, to the fire-eyed goddess of smoky war. The war-god Mars will sit on his altar, up to his ears in blood. I am on fire, knowing that this rich prize is so near, and yet still not ours. Come, bring me my horse, who will carry me like a lightning bolt to face the Prince of Wales. Then this Harry will meet that Harry, my horse against his horse; we’ll meet and never separate, till one of us falls down as a corpse. Oh, I wish that Glendower were here!I have more news: as I passed through the town of Worcester, I heard that Glendower won’t be able to collect his army for two more weeks.That’s the worst news I’ve heard so far.
