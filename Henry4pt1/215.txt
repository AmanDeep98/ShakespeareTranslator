How bloodily the sun begins to peerAbove yon busky hill. The day looks paleAt his distemp'rature.   The southern windDoth play the trumpet to his purposes,And by his hollow whistling in the leavesForetells a tempest and a blust'ring day.Then with the losers let it sympathize,For nothing can seem foul to those that win.How now, my Lord of Worcester? 'Tis not wellThat you and I should meet upon such termsAs now we meet. You have deceived our trustAnd made us doff our easy robes of peaceTo crush our old limbs in ungentle steel.This is not well, my lord; this is not well.What say you to it? Will you again unknitThis curlish knot of all-abhorrèd warAnd move in that obedient orb againWhere you did give a fair and natural light,And be no more an exhaled meteor,A prodigy of fear and a portentOf broachèd mischief to the unborn times?#LBSFORGOLDHow bloody the sun looks as it peers over that massive hill. The day looks pale—it must be sick to see the sun in such a mood.The southern wind is playing its trumpet, to announce to the world what the sun means. And judging by the whistling leaves, it’s going to be a stormy, windy day.Then let it take the losers' side. To winners, nothing seems unpleasant.Hello there, my lord of Worcester! It isn’t right that you and I are meeting under these circumstances. You have betrayed my trust. You forced me to put aside my comfortable peacetime clothing and instead have made me crush my old body into hard, military armor. That isn’t right, sir, that isn’t right. What do you have to say about it? Will you untie this ill-tempered knot of hateful war? Will you return to my loyalty? When you circled me, your King, in your obedient orbit, you shone beautifully and naturally. Now you blaze like a comet: a fearful omen, and a signal that evil will be released into the future.
