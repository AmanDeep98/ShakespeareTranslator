Thou art an unjust man in saying so. Thou or any man knows
where to have me, thou knave, thou.
Thou sayest true, hostess, and he slanders thee most grossly.So he doth you, my lord, and said this other day you owed
him a thousand pound.
Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?A thousand pound, Hal? A million. Thy love is worth a
million; thou owest me thy love.
Nay, my lord, he called you “jack,” and said he would cudgel
you.
Did I, Bardolph?Indeed, Sir John, you said so.Yea, if he said my ring was copper.I say ’tis copper. Darest thou be as good as thy word now?Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare, but as
thou art Prince, I fear thee as I fear the roaring of a lion’s
whelp.
And why not as the lion?The King is to be feared as the lion. Dost thou think I’ll fear
thee as I fear thy father? Nay, an I do, I pray God my girdle
break.
#LBSFORGOLDYou’re awful for saying so: you or any man would know where to put me, you brute, you!You’re right, hostess, and he has really insulted you.He insulted you, too, my lord. Just the other day, he said you owed him a thousand pounds.Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pounds?A thousand pounds, Hal? A million. Your love is worth a million, and you owe me your love.No, sir. He called you a bastard and said he’d beat you.Did I, Bardolph?Indeed, Sir John, you said so.That’s right, if he said my ring was junk and made of copper.And I do say that it’s made of copper. So will you dare keep your word and beat me?Hal, know this: if you were only a man, I would dare. But since you’re also a Prince, I’m scared of you, as much as I’m scared by the roar of a lion’s cub.Why the cub and not the lion?Only the King is as frightening as the lion. You think I’m as scared of you as I am of your father? If I am, I pray to God for my beltThe breaking of a belt was considered bad luck.belt to break.
