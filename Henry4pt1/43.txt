(to NORTHUMBERLAND) He apprehends a world of figures here,But not the form of what he should attend.—
(to HOTSPUR) Good cousin, give me audience for a while.I cry you mercy.   Those same noble ScotsThat are your prisoners—   I’ll keep them all.By God, he shall not have a Scot of them.No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not.I’ll keep them, by this hand!   You start awayAnd lend no ear unto my purposes:Those prisoners you shall keep—   Nay, I will. That’s flat!He said he would not ransom Mortimer,Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer.But I will find him when he lies asleep,And in his ear I’ll hollo “Mortimer.”Nay,I’ll have a starling shall be taught to speakNothing but “Mortimer,” and give it himTo keep his anger still in motion.Hear you, cousin, a word.#LBSFORGOLD
(to NORTHUMBERLAND) He sees a world built by his imagination,
								but that world is not the one he should be paying attention to.
								(to HOTSPUR) Nephew, listen to me a minute.I beg your pardon.These Scotsmen that you’ve taken prisoner —I’ll keep them all. By God, the King won’t get a single Scot, even if having a Scot would save his soul! I’ll keep them, I swear.
You’re off again and not listening to me. You will get to keep the prisoners —Yes, I will; there’s no doubt about it. The King said he would not pay ransom for Mortimer. He forbid me from speaking of Mortimer. But I’ll find him when he’s sleeping, and I’ll shout “Mortimer!” into his ears. No; I’ll get a bird and teach it to say nothing but “Mortimer,” and I’ll give it to the King to anger him forever.Listen, nephew, please.
