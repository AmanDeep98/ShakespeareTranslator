Owen Glendower.Owen, Owen, the same, and his son-in-law Mortimer, and
old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of Scots,
Douglas, that runs a-horseback up a hill perpendicular—
He that rides at high speed, and with his pistol kills a sparrow
flying.
You have hit it.So did he never the sparrow.Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him. He will not run.Why, what a rascal art thou then to praise him so for
running?
A-horseback, you cuckoo, but afoot he will not budge a foot.Yes, Jack, upon instinct.I grant you, upon instinct. Well, he is there too, and one
Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more: Worcester is
stolen away tonight. Thy father’s beard is turned white with
the news. You may buy land now as cheap as stinking
mackerel.
#LBSFORGOLDOh, Glendower.Owen, Owen, that’s the one. And his son-in-law Mortimer, and old Northumberland, and Douglas, that lively Scot of Scots, who can ride a horse straight up a wall—The man who can ride at high speeds, then kill a flying sparrow with his pistol.You’ve hit it; that’s him exactly.I may have hit it, but Owen never hit the sparrow.Well, that rascal has bravery in him; he won’t run away.Why, you rascal! You just praised him for running!He’ll run on his horse, you cuckoo. But when fighting on foot, he’ll never budge.Yes he will, Jack. By instinct.You’re right, by instinct. Well, he’s there, and a man named Mordake, and a thousand Scottish soldiers besides. Worcester snuck out of London tonight, and your father’s hair turned white when he heard. The price of land has dropped as low as a bucket of stinking fish.
