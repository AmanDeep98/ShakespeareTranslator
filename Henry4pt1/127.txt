O monstrous! But one halfpennyworth of bread to this
intolerable deal of sack! What there is else, keep close. We’ll
read it at more advantage. There let him sleep till day. I’ll to

The money shall be paid back again with advantage. Be with

(reads) First, a chicken — two shillings and two pence. Second, sauce — four pence. Third, wine, two gallons —five shillings and eight pence. Fourth, anchovies and dessert wine — two shillings and six pence. Fifth, bread — a halfpenny.Oh horrible! A halfpenny’s worth of bread against this enormous amount of wine? Hang onto everything else you found; we’ll read it when we have time. Let him sleep there till tomorrow. I’ll go to court in the morning. We’re all off to the wars, and you will have honorable positions. I’ll put this fat rogue in charge of an infantry company, and a quarter mile’s march will be the end of him. The money we stole will be repaid with interest. Meet me early in the morning; and with that, good morning, Peto.Good morning, my good lord.
