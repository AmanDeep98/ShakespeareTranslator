My lord, here are letters for you.I cannot read them now.—O gentlemen, the time of life is short;To spend that shortness basely were too longIf life did ride upon a dial’s point,Still ending at the arrival of an hour.An if we live, we live to tread on kings;If die, brave death, when princes die with us.Now, for our consciences, the arms are fairWhen the intent of bearing them is just.My lord, prepare. The King comes on apace.I thank him that he cuts me from my tale,For I profess not talking. Only this:Let each man do his best. And here draw I a sword,Whose temper I intend to stainWith the best blood that I can meet withalIn the adventure of this perilous day.Now, Esperance! Percy! And set on.Sound all the lofty instruments of war,And by that music let us all embrace,For, heaven to earth, some of us never shallA second time do such a courtesy.#LBSFORGOLDMy lord, I have some letters for you.I can’t read them now. Oh, gentlemen, life is short. But if you spend that brief time shamefully, you are wasting your time: even if life lasted only an hour, it would still be too long. If we live, it will be in triumph over kings. If we die, it will be a glorious death, since princes will die with us. As for our consciences, our battle is fair: it’s right to bear arms when the cause is just.My lord, get ready. The King has launched his attack.I thank him for cutting off my speech, since I have no talent for speaking. Only one more thing: each man should do his best, and with that I will draw my sword. On this dangerous day, I intend to stain it with the best blood I can find. “Hope is my comfort!” Percy! Let’s go! Sound all the imposing instruments of battle, and let’s embrace one another to the tune of that music. For, by heaven, some of us will never be able to do that again.
