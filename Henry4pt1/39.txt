I cannot blame him. Was not he proclaimedBy Richard, that dead is, the next of blood?He was; I heard the proclamation.And then it was when the unhappy King—Whose wrongs in us God pardon!—did set forthUpon his Irish expedition;From whence he, intercepted, did returnTo be deposed and shortly murderèd.And for whose death we in the world’s wide mouthLive scandalized and foully spoken of.But soft, I pray you. Did King Richard thenProclaim my brother Edmund MortimerHeir to the crown?   He did; myself did hear it.Nay then, I cannot blame his cousin KingThat wished him on the barren mountains starve.But shall it be that you that set the crownUpon the head of this forgetful manAnd for his sake wear the detested blotOf murderous subornation—shall it beThat you a world of curses undergo,Being the agents or base second means,The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?O, pardon me that I descend so lowTo show the line and the predicamentWherein you range under this subtle King.Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,Or fill up chronicles in time to come,That men of your nobility and power#LBSFORGOLDI don’t blame him. Didn’t the late King Richard II proclaim that Mortimer should be next in line for the throne?He did; I heard the proclamation. That was when the wretched King Richard (may God forgive us for wronging him!) set out to invade Ireland. When that was interrupted, he returned to England, only to be deposed and then murdered.And for our part in his death, the whole world is scandalized by us, and speaks ill of us.Stop a moment, please. Did King Richard really proclaim that my brother-in-law Edmund Mortimer was next in line for the throne?He did. I heard it myself.Then I can’t blame King Henry for wishing for him to starve in the wilderness. But is it right that you—who put the crown on Henry’s forgetful head, and who carry the accusations of murder for Henry’s sake—should be the target of the world’s curses? When you were only accomplices and instruments? Is it right to blame the ropes, the ladder, or the hangman for a man’s death? Forgive me for mentioning that you two are like those sordid objects, having been exploited by this conniving King. But will you stand by while people today speak of your shame?
