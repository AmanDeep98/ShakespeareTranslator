God forbid!I told him gently of our grievances,Of his oath-breaking, which he mended thusBy now forswearing that he is forsworn.He calls us “rebels,” “traitors,” and will scourgeWith haughty arms this hateful name in us.Arm, gentlemen, to arms. For I have thrownA brave defiance in King Henry’s teeth,And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it,Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.The Prince of Wales stepped forth before the King,And, nephew, challenged you to single fight.#LBSFORGOLDHere comes your nephew.My uncle’s back. Free Westmoreland, his hostage. Uncle, what’s happening?The King will beckon you to battle shortly.Have Westmoreland deliver your message of defiance.Douglas, go tell him to do that.Indeed, I will, and gladly.The King doesn’t appear willing to forgive us.Did you ask him to? God forbid!I politely told him what our issues were. I accused him of breaking his promise to us, and here’s how he answered: he lied about the fact that he lied. He called us rebels, traitors, and said he’d punish us with his mighty army.Get your weapons, gentlemen, get your weapons! I sent King Henry a brave and defiant message, and Westmoreland, who was our hostage, will deliver it. This will surely bring the battle on immediately.The Prince of Wales stepped forward, nephew, and challenged you to a one-on-one fight.
