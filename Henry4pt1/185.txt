Faith, and so we should, where now remainsA sweet reversion. We may boldly spendUpon the hope of what is to come in.A comfort of retirement lives in this.A rendezvous, a home to fly unto,If that the devil and mischance look bigUpon the maidenhead of our affairs.But yet I would your father had been here.The quality and hair of our attemptBrooks no division. It will be thoughtBy some that know not why he is awayThat wisdom, loyalty, and mere dislikeOf our proceedings kept the Earl from hence.And think how such an apprehensionMay turn the tide of fearful factionAnd breed a kind of question in our cause.For well you know, we of the off'ring sideMust keep aloof from strict arbitrament,And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whenceThe eye of reason may pry in upon us.This absence of your father’s draws a curtainThat shows the ignorant a kind of fearBefore not dreamt of.#LBSFORGOLDThat’s right. We have a chance at a rich inheritance; we can take a risk now, based on the promise of success to come. That gives us comfort, something to fall back on.It gives us a refuge, a home we can always run to, in case the devil or misfortune ruins these early plans.I still wish your father were here. Our endeavor here won’t withstand any division. People who don’t realize your father is sick will assume that he knows some kind of secret, or that he is loyal to the King, or that he doesn’t approve of how we’re handling things. And just imagine how that kind of mistrust could frighten our more timid supporters, and lead them to doubt us. You know very well that the challenger must always avoid careful examination. We must seal every crack, every loophole, which skeptics might look through to see weaknesses. Your father’s absence draws the curtains back and reveals frightful things to ignorant people, who had never had a reason to fear before.
