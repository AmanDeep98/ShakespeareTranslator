   And so they shall.In faith, it is exceedingly well aimed.And ’tis no little reason bids us speedTo save our heads by raising of a head,For, bear ourselves as even as we can,The King will always think him in our debt,And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,Till he hath found a time to pay us home.And see already how he doth beginTo make us strangers to his looks of love.He does, he does. We’ll be revenged on him.Cousin, farewell. No further go in thisThan I by letters shall direct your course.When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,I’ll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer,Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,As I will fashion it, shall happily meetTo bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,Which now we hold at much uncertainty.Farewell, good brother. We shall thrive, I trust.Uncle, adieu: O, let the hours be shortTill fields and blows and groans applaud our sport.#LBSFORGOLDYes, they will.I swear, it’s extremely well thought out.And we’ve got good reasons to hurry and save ourselves by raising an army. No matter how hard we try to look like everything’s fine, the King will always think he owes us for having helped him take the throne, and he’ll worry that we don’t feel we’ve been properly compensated. Until he finds a way to pay us for good—by killing us. You can see that he’s already begun to distance himself from us.He has, he has. We’ll get revenge!Nephew, farewell. Don’t do any more than I tell you to do in the letters I’ll write you. When the time comes, which will be soon, I’ll sneak off to Glendower and Mortimer. I’ll plan it so that you, Douglas and all our armies will arrive together. Then we can face our future with strength instead of the uncertainty we feel now.So long, brother. I believe we’ll prevail.Good bye, uncle. Oh, I hope it won’t be long until battlefields and collisions and groans are witnesses to our game of war!
