So I told him, my lord, and I said I heard your Grace say so.
And, my lord, he speaks most vilely of you, like a foul-
mouthed man as he is;,and said he would cudgel you.
What, he did not!There’s neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.There’s no more faith in thee than in a stewed prune, nor no
more truth in thee than in a drawn fox, and for womanhood,
Maid Marian may be the deputy’s wife of the ward to thee.
Go, you thing, go.
Say, what thing, what thing?What thing! Why, a thing to thank God on.I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou shouldst know
it! I am an honest man’s wife, and, setting thy knighthood
aside, thou art a knave to call me so.
Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say
otherwise.
Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?What beast? Why, an otter.An otter, Sir John. Why an otter?Why, she’s neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not where to
have her.
#LBSFORGOLDThat’s what I said, my lord. And I said I’d heard you say so, and then he said awful things about you, like the foul-mouthed man that he is. He said he’d beat you.What? He did?If he didn’t, I’m not faithful, trustworthy or womanly.You’re about as faithful as a whore, as trustworthy as a fox on the run, and—as for womanhood—a man in a dress is the minister’s wife compared to you. Get out of here, you thing, get out.Thing? What thing?What thing? A thing to say “thank God” for.I am not a thing to say “thank God” for, I want you to know; I am an honest man’s wife. And ignoring the fact that you are a knight, you are a brute for calling me that.Well, if you ignore the fact that you’re a woman, then I suppose that would make you an animal.What animal, you brute?What animal? Why, an otter.An otter, Sir John? Why an otter?Because she’s not quite a fish and not quite a mammal. A man wouldn’t know where to put her.
