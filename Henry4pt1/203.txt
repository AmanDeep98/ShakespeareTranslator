Content.Tonight, say I.Come, come it nay not be. I wonder much,Being men of such great leading as you are,That you foresee not what impedimentsDrag back our expedition. Certain horseOf my cousin Vernon’s are not yet come up.Your Uncle Worcester’s horse came but today,And now their pride and mettle is asleep,Their courage with hard labor tame and dull,That not a horse is half the half of himself.So are the horses of the enemyIn general journey-bated and brought low.The better part of ours are full of rest.The number of the King exceedeth ours.For God’s sake, cousin, stay till all come in.I come with gracious offers from the King,If you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt, and would to GodYou were of our determination.Some of us love you well, and even those someEnvy your great deservings and good nameBecause you are not of our qualityBut stand against us like an enemy.#LBSFORGOLDThat’s enough.Tonight, I say.Come on, we can’t do that. I wonder how—being the great leaders you are—you cannot see the problems we’re facing. My cousin has yet to arrive with his horses, and your Uncle Worcester’s troops only arrived today. Their spirit and their bravery is asleep; their courage is dulled and tamed by the hard journey. They don’t have even a quarter of their usual strength.The enemy’s horses are tired from the journey as well. The majority of ours are well-rested.But the King has more men then we do. For God’s sake, nephew, wait until everyone arrives.I’m here with a generous offer from the King, if you’ll listen to me and treat me with respect.Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt. I wish to God you were on our side. Many of us think very highly of you, though we begrudge you your honor and reputation, since you fight on the enemy’s side.
