I prithee, Harry, withdraw thyself. Thou bleedest too much.Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.I beseech your Majesty, make up,Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.I will do so.—My Lord of Westmoreland,Lead him to his tent.Come, my lord, I’ll lead you to your tent.Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help,And God forbid a shallow scratch should driveThe Prince of Wales from such a field as this,Where stained nobility lies trodden on,And rebels' arms triumph in massacres.We breathe too long. Come, cousin Westmoreland,Our duty this way lies. For God’s sake, come.By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster.I did not think thee lord of such a spirit.Before, I loved thee as a brother, John,But now, I do respect thee as my soul.#LBSFORGOLDPlease, Harry, get out of here: you’re bleeding too heavily. John of Lancaster, go with him.I won’t leave, my lord, unless I am bleeding too.I beg your highness, advance. Your army will lose heart if it sees you falling back.I will. My Lord of Westmoreland, take him to his tent.
(to PRINCE HENRY) Come, my lord. I’ll lead you to your tent.Lead me, my lord? I don’t need your help. God forbid that a shallow scratch could make the Prince of Wales retreat from a battlefield like this one, where great men are falling and being trampled upon, and rebels are triumphing in their massacres!We’ve stopped for too long. Come, Westmoreland. We have work to do. For God’s sake, come on!By God, you have deceived me, Lancaster. I didn’t think you were that brave. Before, I loved you as a brother; now, I respect you as my soulmate.
