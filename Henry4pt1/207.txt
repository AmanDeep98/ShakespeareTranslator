Tut, I came not to hear this.   Then to the point.In short time after, he deposed the King,Soon after that deprived him of his lifeAnd, in the neck of that, tasked the whole state.To make that worse, suffered his kinsman March(Who is, if every owner were well placed,Indeed his king) to be engaged in Wales,There without ransom to lie forfeited,Disgraced me in my happy victories,Sought to entrap me by intelligence,Rated mine uncle from the council board,In rage dismissed my father from the court,Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,And in conclusion drove us to seek outThis head of safety, and withal to pryInto his title, the which we findToo indirect for long continuance.#LBSFORGOLDI didn’t come here to listen to this.Then I’ll get to the point. A little while later, he overthrew King Richard. Soon after that, he killed him. And right after that, he raised taxes on everyone. To make matters worse, he allowed his kinsman Mortimer—who by rights ought to be the king—to be imprisoned in Wales, and remain there without ransom. He tried to use my victories to disgrace me, and tried to trap me with spies. He dismissed my uncle from his royal Council, threw my father out of the royal court, broke promise after promise, and committed crime after crime. In conclusion, he forced us to raise this army for our own safety, and to question his claim on the crown, which we believe is too flimsy to stand.
