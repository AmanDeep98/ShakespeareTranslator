My blood hath been too cold and temperate,Unapt to stir at these indignities,And you have found me, for accordinglyYou tread upon my patience. But be sureI will from henceforth rather be myself,Mighty and to be feared, than my condition,Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,And therefore lost that title of respectWhich the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.Our house, my sovereign liege, little deservesThe scourge of greatness to be used on it,And that same greatness too which our own handsHave holp to make so portly.   My lord—Worcester, get thee gone; for I do seeDanger and disobedience in thine eye.O sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,And majesty might never yet endureThe moody frontier of a servant brow.You have good leave to leave us. When we needYour use and counsel, we shall send for you.
(to NORTHUMBERLAND)You were about to speak.#LBSFORGOLDI’ve been too calm and even-tempered, unwilling to react angrily to these indignities. You have discovered this, and so you’ve walked all over my patience. Know this: from now on, I’m going to be my royal self again, powerful and frightening. My natural condition, which was as smooth as oil and soft as feathers, has lost me the respect that powerful people only pay to the similarly powerful.My lord, the Percy familyWorcester, Northumberland, and Hotspur are all members of the Percy family.Percy family does not deserve to bear the brunt of your anger and power, especially since we helped you become so powerful in the first place.Your Highness —Worcester, get out. I see danger and disobedience in your eyes. You carry yourself too boldly and proudly, and royalty should never have to endure a servant’s frowning face. You have my permission to leave now. When I need you or your advice, I’ll call for you.
