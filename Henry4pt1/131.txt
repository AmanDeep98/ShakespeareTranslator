And I say the earth was not of my mind,If you suppose as fearing you it shook.The heavens were all on fire; the earth did tremble.O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,And not in fear of your nativity.Diseas—d nature oftentimes breaks forthIn strange eruptions; oft the teeming earthIs with a kind of colic pinched and vexedBy the imprisoning of unruly windWithin her womb, which, for enlargement striving,Shakes the old beldam earth and topples downSteeples and moss-grown towers. At your birthOur grandam earth, having this distemperature,In passion shook.   Cousin, of many menI do not bear these crossings. Give me leaveTo tell you once again that at my birthThe front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,The goats ran from the mountains, and the herdsWere strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.These signs have marked me extraordinary,And all the courses of my life do showI am not in the roll of common men.Where is he living, clipped in with the seaThat chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,Which calls me pupil or hath read to me?And bring him out that is but woman’s sonCan trace me in the tedious ways of artAnd hold me pace in deep experiments.I think there’s no man speaks better Welsh.I’ll to dinner.#LBSFORGOLDAnd I say that if you think the earth shook because it was afraid of you, then the earth and I do not agree.The heavens were all on fire, and the earth trembled.Oh! Then the earth trembled when it saw the heavens on fire, and not in fear of your birth. When nature is diseased, strange eruptions can break forth. Often, the earth is pinched with a kind of colic, and troubled by gas in her belly. When that gas struggles to be released, it shakes old Mother Earth, bringing down steeples and moss-covered towers. When you were born, our Mother Earth was ill and shook with pain.Kinsman, I don’t take this kind of contrary behavior from many people. With your permission, I’ll say one more time that when I was born, the heavens were full of shooting stars. The goats ran down from the mountains, and herds of animals stampeded strangely through the fields. These signs marked me as an extraordinary person. All the events of my life prove that I should not be counted with ordinary men. Is there a man who lives anywhere within England, Scotland, or Wales who can say I learned from him, or that he taught me? And bring forward one human who can follow me in the complicated ways of magic, or keep up with me in my obscure experiments.Well, nobody speaks better WelshTo the English, Welsh often sounded like a barbaric language; Hotspur implies that no one speaks better nonsense then Glendower.Welsh. I’m going to lunch.
