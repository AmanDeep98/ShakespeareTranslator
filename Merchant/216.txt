Your husband is at hand. I hear his trumpet.We are no tell-tales, madam. Fear you not.This night methinks is but the daylight sick.It looks a little paler. 'Tis a daySuch as the day is when the sun is hid.
(to PORTIA) We should
        hold day with the Antipodes,If you would walk in absence of the sun.Let me give light, but let me not be light.For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,And never be Bassanio so for me.But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.This is the man, this is Antonio,To whom I am so infinitely bound.You should in all sense be much bound to him.For as I hear he was much bound for you.No more than I am well acquitted of.Sir, you are very welcome to our house.It must appear in other ways than words,Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.#LBSFORGOLDYour husband’s near. I hear his trumpet. We’re not tattle-tales,
        madam, don’t worry.I think this night is just like sick daylight. It only looks a little paler. It looks
        like a day when the sun is hidden.
(to PORTIA) If you walked
        outside at night, it would be daylight here at the same time as on the other side of the
        world.I’ll give light“Light” could mean having loose morals.light to men, but I’ll never be light or unchaste. An unfaithful wife makes a
        husband worry, and I’ll never let Bassanio worry if I can help it. I hope God
        figures it all out! Welcome home, my husband.Thank you, darling. I’d like to introduce you to my friend. This is Antonio,
        my dearest friend. We are closely tied.You should be tied to him, since he tied himself up so much for you.But I’ve been paid back well.Sir, welcome to our house. But action speaks louder than words, so I’ll cut
        short these polite words.
