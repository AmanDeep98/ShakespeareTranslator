    Now he goesWith no less presence but with much more loveThan young Alcides, when he did redeemThe virgin tribute paid by howling TroyTo the sea monster. I stand for sacrifice.The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,With blearèd visages come forth to viewThe issue of th' exploit.—Go, Hercules!Live thou, I live. With much, much more dismayI view the fight than thou that makest the fray.

Tell me where is fancy bred.

Or in the heart or in the head?

How begot, how nourishèd?
Reply, reply.

It is engendered in the eyes,

With gazing fed, and fancy dies

In the cradle where it lies.

Let us all ring fancy’s knell

I’ll begin it.—Ding, dong, bell.
Ding, dong, bell.#LBSFORGOLDBassanio’s walking to the boxes now. He looks as dignified as Hercules did
        when he saved the princess Hesione from the sea monster. But he loves me more than Hercules
        loved the princess. I’ll play Hesione, and everyone else will be the bystanders
        watching with tear-streaked faces. We’ve all come out to see what will
        happen.—Go, Hercules! If you survive, I’ll live. I’m more
        anxious watching you fight than you are in the fight itself.

Tell me where do our desires start,

In the heart or in the head?

How are they created, how sustained?
  Answer me, answer me.
(singing)

Desires start in the eyes,

Sustained by gazing, and desires die

Very young.

Let’s all mourn our dead desires.

I’ll begin—Ding, dong, bell.
  Ding, dong, bell.
