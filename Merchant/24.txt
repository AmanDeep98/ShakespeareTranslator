Yes, yes, it was Bassanio—as I think he was so called.True, madam. He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes
looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy
praise.
How now, what news?The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their
leave. And there is a forerunner come from a fifth, the
Prince of Morocco, who brings word the prince his
master will be here tonight.
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as I
can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his
approach. If he have the condition of a saint and the
complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me
than wive me. Come, Nerissa.—(to
        SERVANT) Sirrah, go
before.
 Whiles we shut the gates upon one wooer
Another knocks at the door.
#LBSFORGOLDYes, yes, that was Bassanio. I think that was his name.Yes, madam, that’s the one. He deserves a beautiful wife more than all the
        other men I’ve ever seen.I remember him well, and my memory tells me that he deserves your praise.Hello, do you have any news?The four suitors are looking for you so they can say goodbye, madam. And
        there’s a messenger representing a fifth one, the prince of Morocco, who says the
        prince will be here tonight.If I could say hello to the fifth one as happily as I’ll say goodbye to the
        first four, I’d be very happy he’s coming. If he’s as good as a
        saint but is black like a devil, I’d rather he hear my confession than marry me.
        Let’s go, Nerissa.—(to the
        SERVANT) Go ahead. As soon as we shut the door on one suitor,
        another one starts knocking.
