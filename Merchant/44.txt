   Even for that I thank you.Therefore I pray you lead me to the casketsTo try my fortune. By this scimitarThat slew the Sophy and a Persian princeThat won three fields of Sultan Solyman,I would o'erstare the sternest eyes that look,Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,To win the lady. But, alas the while!If Hercules and Lychas play at diceWhich is the better man, the greater throwMay turn by fortune from the weaker hand.So is Alcides beaten by his page,And so may I, blind fortune leading me,Miss that which one unworthier may attainAnd die with grieving.    You must take your chance,And either not attempt to choose at allOr swear before you choose, if you choose wrongNever to speak to lady afterwardIn way of marriage. Therefore be advised.Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.First, forward to the temple. After dinnerYour hazard shall be made.    Good fortune then!—To make me blessed or cursed’st among men.#LBSFORGOLDThank you for saying that. Show me the caskets and let me try my luck. I swear by my
        sword, which killed the Shah of Persia and a Persian prince and defeated the Sultan Suleiman
        three times, that I would face the meanest-looking warriors on earth. I would act braver
        than the bravest man on earth. I would grab bear cubs from a ferocious mother bear, or tease
        a hungry lion—all of this in order to win your love, lady. But this is bad! If
        the hero Hercules and his servant Lychas rolled the dice, which would win? Not the greater
        hero. Just the one who happened to be luckier that time. And just as Hercules could be
        beaten by his servant, blind luck could make me lose this test and make someone worse than
        me win. If that happened, I’d die of sadness.You have to take your chances. Either don’t choose at all, or swear beforehand
        that if you choose incorrectly you’ll never talk about marriage to any woman again.
        Think about it carefully.Fine, I swear I won’t ever get married if I choose incorrectly. Let me take my
        chances.Let’s go to the temple first. You can take your chances after dinner.I’ll try my luck then. I’ll either be the luckiest or the unluckiest
        man alive.
