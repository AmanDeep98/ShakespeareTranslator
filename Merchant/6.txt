Some that will evermore peep through their eyesAnd laugh like parrots at a bagpiper,And other of such vinegar aspectThat they’ll not show their teeth in way of smileThough Nestor swear the jest be laughable.Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,Gratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare ye well.We leave you now with better company.I would have stayed till I had made you merryIf worthier friends had not prevented me.Your worth is very dear in my regard.I take it your own business calls on youAnd you embrace th' occasion to depart.
(to BASSANIO, LORENZO,
        GRATIANO)
Good morrow, my good lords.
(to SALARINO and
        SOLANIO)
Good signors both, when shall we laugh? Say, when?You grow exceeding strange. Must it be so?We’ll make our leisures to attend on yours.My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,We two will leave you. But at dinnertimeI pray you have in mind where we must meet.I will not fail you.#LBSFORGOLDSome people will laugh at anything, and others are so grouchy they won’t even
        crack a smile when they hear something hysterically funny.Here comes your cousin Bassanio. And Gratiano and Lorenzo too. Goodbye, then.
        We’ll leave you to talk to them. They’re better company.I would’ve stayed to cheer you up, if your nobler friends hadn’t
        shown up.You’re both very precious to me. But I understand. You need to leave to take
        care of your own business.
(to BASSANIO,
        LORENZO, and GRATIANO) Good
        morning, gentlemen.
(to SALARINO and
        SOLANIO) Hello, friends. When are we going to have fun
        together again? Just name the time. We never see you anymore. Does it have to be that
       way?Let us know when you want to get together. We’re available.Bassanio, we’ll say goodbye for now, since you’ve found Antonio. But
