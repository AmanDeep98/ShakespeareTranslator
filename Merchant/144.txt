    Let him alone.I’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.He seeks my life. His reason well I know.I oft delivered from his forfeituresMany that have at times made moan to me.Therefore he hates me.    I am sure the dukeWill never grant this forfeiture to hold.The duke cannot deny the course of law.For the commodity that strangers haveWith us in Venice, if it be denied,Will much impeach the justice of his state,Since that the trade and profit of the cityConsisteth of all nations. Therefore go.These griefs and losses have so bated me,That I shall hardly spare a pound of fleshTomorrow to my bloody creditor.—Well, jailer, on.—Pray God Bassanio comeTo see me pay his debt, and then I care not.#LBSFORGOLDLeave him alone. I won’t follow him around with useless pleas anymore. He
        wants me dead. I know the real reason. I’ve often given money to people who were
        unable to pay back their loans to him. That’s why he hates me.I’m sure the duke will never allow this contract to be enforced.The duke can’t deny the law, because that would threaten the security of all
        foreign merchants in Venice, and that’s how the city makes its money. If the
        government disregards the law, it will be discredited. So go. I’ve lost so much
        weight worrying about my losses have that I’ll hardly have a pound of flesh to
        spare for my bloody creditor tomorrow.—Well, jailer, let’s
        go.—I hope to God that Bassanio comes to see me pay his debt. After that, I
        don’t care what happens.
