Thus hath the candle singed the moth.O these deliberate fools! When they do choose,They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.The ancient saying is no heresy.Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.Where is my lady?    Here. What would my lord?Madam, there is alighted at your gateA young Venetian, one that comes beforeTo signify th' approaching of his lord,From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,To wit—besides commends and courteous breath—Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seenSo likely an ambassador of love.A day in April never came so sweetTo show how costly summer was at hand,As this forespurrer comes before his lord.No more, I pray thee. I am half afeardThou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,Thou spend’st such high-day wit in praising him.—Come, come, Nerissa, for I long to seeQuick Cupid’s post that comes so mannerly.Bassanio, Lord Love, if thy will it be!#LBSFORGOLDThese men are like moths, drawn to these boxes as if they were flames. This is how the
        candle burned the moth. Oh, these fools! When they choose, they only know how to
       lose.You know what they say. Destiny chooses when you’ll die and who
        you’ll marry.Come on, close the curtain, Nerissa.Where’s lady Portia?Here. How can I help you, sir?Madam, a young Venetian man has arrived to tell us his master is about to arrive. This
        lord has sent gifts. Besides his nice polite greetings, his gifts are expensive. I
        haven’t seen such a promising candidate for your love. This servant has arrived
        before his master the way a sweet spring day hints about a lush summer. But there’s
        never been an April day as promising as this.Please don’t tell me any more. I’m almost afraid you’re
        going to tell me he’s a relative of yours, because you’re going so crazy
        praising him. Come on, Nerissa, I want to go see this man who’s come so
        courteously.I hope it’s Bassanio coming to win Portia!
