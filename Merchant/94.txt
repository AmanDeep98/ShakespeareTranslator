Let good Antonio look he keep his day,Or he shall pay for this.    Marry, well remembered.I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday,Who told me, in the narrow seas that partThe French and English, there miscarriedA vessel of our country richly fraught.I thought upon Antonio when he told me,And wished in silence that it were not his.You were best to tell Antonio what you hear—Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.I saw Bassanio and Antonio part.Bassanio told him he would make some speedOf his return. He answered, “Do not so.Slubber not business for my sake, BassanioBut stay the very riping of the time.And for the Jew’s bond which he hath of me,Let it not enter in your mind of love.Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughtsTo courtship and such fair ostents of loveAs shall conveniently become you there.”And even there, his eye being big with tears,Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,And with affection wondrous sensibleHe wrung Bassanio’s hand. And so they parted.#LBSFORGOLDI hope Antonio repays his loan on time, or he’ll suffer for this.That’s a good point. I spoke with a Frenchman yesterday who said that a
        Venetian ship loaded with treasure was wrecked in the English Channel. I thought about
        Antonio when he told me. I silently hoped it wasn’t his ship.You should tell Antonio what you hear—but don’t do it suddenly,
        because it might upset him.There’s no nicer guy in the whole world. I saw Bassanio and Antonio say
        goodbye. Bassanio told him he’d try to hurry back. Antonio answered
        “Don’t rush. Don’t do a sloppy job for my sake, Bassanio. Stay
        until everything is finished. As for the Jew’s contract, don’t let it be a
        factor in your plans. Be happy and concentrate your thoughts on love and how to win your
        love.” Then his eyes started tearing up. He turned his face away. Then he shook
        Bassanio’s hand affectionately—and they separated.
