None but that ugly treason of mistrustWhich makes me fear th' enjoying of my love.There may as well be amity and life'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rackWhere men enforcèd do speak anything.Promise me life, and I’ll confess the truth.Well then, confess and live.    “Confess and
        love”Had been the very sum of my confession.O happy torment, when my torturerDoth teach me answers for deliverance!But let me to my fortune and the caskets.Away, then. I am locked in one of them.If you do love me you will find me out.—Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.Let music sound while he doth make his choice.Then if he lose he makes a swanlike end,Fading in music. That the comparisonMay stand more proper, my eye shall be the streamAnd watery deathbed for him. He may win,And what is music then? Then music isEven as the flourish when true subjects bowTo a new-crownèd monarch. Such it isAs are those dulcet sounds in break of dayThat creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s earAnd summon him to marriage.#LBSFORGOLDThe only treason I’m guilty of is worrying that I’m never going to
        get to enjoy you. Treason has nothing at all to do with my love. They’re as
        opposite as hot and cold.Hmmm, I’m not sure I believe what you’re saying. Men under torture
        will confess anything.Promise me you’ll let me live, and I’ll confess the truth.All right then, confess and live.“Confess and love” is more like it. Oh, torture’s fun
        when my torturer tells me what I have to say to go free! But let me try my luck on the
        boxes.Go ahead, then. I’m locked in one of them. If you really love me,
        you’ll find me.—Nerissa and the rest of you, get away from him. Play
        some music while he chooses. Then if he loses, it’ll be his swan song, music before
        the end. And since swans need water to swim in, I’ll cry him a river when he loses.
        But on the other hand, he may win. What music should we play then? If he wins, the music
        should be like the majestic trumpets that blare when subjects bow to a newly crowned
        monarch. It’s the sweet sounds at daybreak that the dreaming bridegroom hears on
        his wedding morning, calling him to the church.
