Past all expressing. It is very meetThe Lord Bassanio live an upright life,For having such a blessing in his lady,He finds the joys of heaven here on earth.And if on earth he do not merit it,In reason he should never come to heaven.Why, if two gods should play some heavenly matchAnd on the wager lay two earthly women,And Portia one, there must be something elsePawned with the other, for the poor rude worldHath not her fellow.   Even such a husbandHast thou of me as she is for a wife.Nay, but ask my opinion too of that!I will anon. First let us go to dinner.Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.No, pray thee, let it serve for table talk.Then howsome'er thou speak’st ’mong other thingsI shall digest it.   Well, I’ll set you forth.#LBSFORGOLDI like her more than I can say. Bassanio should live an upstanding life because having
        a wife like Portia is a blessing. It’s as if he found heaven here on earth. And if
        he doesn’t deserve this joy on earth, he’ll never deserve it in heaven.
        Imagine what would happen if two gods in heaven made a bet. If one of them used Portia as
        his stake, the other god would have a hard time coming up with a human woman to match her
        value. The poor rude world doesn’t have her equal.As good a wife as she is, that’s how good a husband I am to you.I’ll be the judge of that!I’ll give you a chance to judge later. First let’s go to
       dinner.No, let me say some good things about you while I’m in the mood.No, please, save it for dinner conversation. That way, no matter what you say,
        I’ll digest it with everything else.In that case I’ll serve you up like a dish of food.
