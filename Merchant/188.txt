O learnèd judge!—Mark, Jew, a learnèd judge!I take this offer then: pay the bond thriceAnd let the Christian go.    Here is the money.Soft!The Jew shall have all justice. Soft, no haste.He shall have nothing but the penalty.O Jew! An upright judge, a learnèd judge!Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor moreBut just a pound of flesh. If thou takest moreOr less than a just pound, be it but so muchAs makes it light or heavy in the substanceOr the division of the twentieth partOf one poor scruple—nay, if the scale do turnBut in the estimation of a hair,Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.A second Daniel!—A Daniel, Jew!Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.Give me my principal, and let me go.I have it ready for thee. Here it is.#LBSFORGOLDOh, what a wise judge!—Pay attention, Jew. A wise judge!In that case I’ll take their offer. Pay me three times the amount of the loan
        and let the Christian go.Here is the money.Wait! The Jew will have justice. Wait, don’t rush! He’s not getting
        anything except the penalty.Oh, Jew, what an upright judge this is! What a wise judge!So get ready to cut off the flesh. Don’t shed any blood, or cut less or more
        than exactly a pound of flesh. If you take more or less than exactly a pound, even if
        it’s just the tiniest fraction of an ounce—if the scale changes by even
        so much as a hair, you die, and all your property will be confiscated.A second Daniel!—A Daniel, Jew! I’ve got you now, pagan.Why is the Jew waiting? Take your penalty.Give me my money and let me go.I have it ready for you. Here it is.
