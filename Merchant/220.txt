I gave my love a ring and made him swearNever to part with it. And here he stands.I dare be sworn for him he would not leave itNor pluck it from his finger for the wealthThat the world masters. Now in faith, Gratiano,You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief.An ’twere to me, I should be mad at it.
(aside) Why, I were best to cut my left hand offAnd swear I lost the ring defending it.My Lord Bassanio gave his ring awayUnto the judge that begged it and indeedDeserved it too. And then the boy, his clerk,That took some pains in writing, he begged mine.And neither man nor master would take aughtBut the two rings.   What ring gave you my lord?Not that, I hope, which you received of me.If I could add a lie unto a faultI would deny it. but you see my fingerHath not the ring upon it. It is gone.Even so void is your false heart of truth.By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bedUntil I see the ring.
(to GRATIANO)
   Nor I in yoursTill I again see mine.#LBSFORGOLDI gave my lover a ring and made him swear never to lose it or give it away. And here he
        is. I’d swear he wouldn’t leave it behind, or even take it off his finger,
        for all the money in the world. To tell the truth, Gratiano, you’re giving your
        wife a valid reason to get upset. If it were me, I’d be very upset too.
(to himself) Maybe I should cut off my left hand and
        swear I lost the ring defending it.Bassanio gave his ring to the judge who asked for it, and deserved it too. And then his
        clerk, who went to a lot of trouble with the writing, begged for mine. Neither of them would
        take anything but the two rings.Which ring did you give away, my lord? Not the one I gave you, I hope.If I could make things better by lying, I’d deny it. But you see my finger
        doesn’t have the ring on it. It’s gone.Just as there’s no ring on your finger, there’s no truth in your
        heart. I swear I’ll never get into your bed until I see the ring again!
(to GRATIANO) Me neither,
        until I see mine again!
