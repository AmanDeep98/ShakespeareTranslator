What, is Antonio here?Ready, so please your grace.I am sorry for thee. Thou art come to answerA stony adversary, an inhuman wretchUncapable of pity, void and emptyFrom any dram of mercy.    I have heardYour grace hath ta'en great pains to qualifyHis rigorous course. But since he stands obdurateAnd that no lawful means can carry meOut of his envy’s reach, I do opposeMy patience to his fury, and am armedTo suffer with a quietness of spiritThe very tyranny and rage of his.Go, one, and call the Jew into the court.He is ready at the door. He comes, my lord.#LBSFORGOLDIs Antonio here?Yes, sir, I’m here.I feel sorry for you. You’ve come to face a ruthless enemy, an inhuman wretch
        incapable of pity, without any feelings of mercy.They tell me you’ve done everything you can to talk him out of what
        he’s doing. But since he remains stubborn, and there’s no legal way to
        protect me from his malice, I’ll just have to take what he’ll give me.
        I’m ready to suffer peacefully whatever he does to me in his cruelty and
       anger.One of you go call the Jew into court here.He’s standing ready outside the door. Here he comes, my lord.
