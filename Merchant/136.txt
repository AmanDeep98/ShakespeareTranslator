I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.There are some shrewd contents in yond same paperThat steals the color from Bassanio’s cheek.Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the worldCould turn so much the constitutionOf any constant man. What, worse and worse?—With leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself,And I must freely have the half of anythingThat this same paper brings you.     O sweet Portia,Here are a few of the unpleasant’st wordsThat ever blotted paper. Gentle lady,When I did first impart my love to you,I freely told you, all the wealth I hadRan in my veins. I was a gentleman,And then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,Rating myself at nothing, you shall seeHow much I was a braggart. When I told youMy state was nothing, I should then have told youThat I was worse than nothing, for indeedI have engaged myself to a dear friend,Engaged my friend to his mere enemyTo feed my means.   Here is a letter, lady,The paper as the body of my friend,And every word in it a gaping wound,Issuing life blood.—But is it true, Salerio?Have all his ventures failed? What, not one hit?From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,From Lisbon, Barbary, and India?And not one vessel ’scape the dreadful touchOf merchant-marring rocks?#LBSFORGOLDI wish you’d won the
        fleeceSalerio puns on “fleece” (the wool from a ram) and “fleets” (groups of ships).fleece he lost.Something bad in that letter is making Bassanio turn pale. Some good friend of his must
        have died, because nothing else in the world could change a man so much. What, does the news
        only get worse?—Please, Bassanio, I’m half of you, so let me bear half
        the burden this letter brings you.Oh Portia, these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper. My
        darling, when I gave my love to you, I told you that all the wealth I had ran within my
        veins—that I have noble blood, but no money. When I said that, I told you the
        truth. But my dear, when I said I was worth nothing, I was actually bragging—I
        should’ve said that I was worse than nothing. I’ve borrowed money from a
        dear friend who in turn borrowed money from his mortal enemy for my sake. Here’s a
        letter, my dear. The paper’s like my friend’s body, and every word in it
        is a bleeding wound on that body.—But is it true, Salerio? Have all his business
        ventures failed? Not even one success? He had ships to Tripolis, Mexico, England, Lisbon,
        North Africa, and India, and not one of these ships avoided the rocks?
