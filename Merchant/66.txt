Nay, we will slink away in supper time,Disguise us at my lodging, and return,All in an hour.We have not made good preparation.We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly ordered,And better in my mind not undertook.'Tis now but four o'clock. We have two hoursTo furnish us.Friend Launcelot, what’s the news?
(giving LORENZO
        the letter)
An it shall please you to break up this, it shall seem to signify.I know the hand. In faith, ’tis a fair hand,And whiter than the paper it writ onIs the fair hand that writ.    Love news, in faith?
(to LORENZO) By your
        leave, sir.#LBSFORGOLDNo, we’ll sneak away at supper time, disguise ourselves with masks at my
        house, and come back in an hour.But we haven’t made any preparations.We haven’t even talked about who’ll be our torchbearers.The masquerade party might turn out terribly if we don’t manage things
        carefully. I think it’s better to call it off.It’s only four o'clock now. We have two hours to get ready.Launcelot, what’s going on?
(he gives LORENZO
        the letter) If you don’t mind opening this letter,
        you can find out for yourself.I recognize the handwriting. It’s beautiful handwriting. And the beautiful
        hand that wrote this letter is whiter than the paper it’s written on.I bet it’s a love letter!
(to LORENZO) May I be
        excused, sir?
