Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio
bound.
Your answer to that?Antonio is a good man.Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?Ho, no, no, no, no. My meaning in saying he is a good
man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient. Yet
his means are in supposition. He hath an argosy bound to
Tripolis, another to the Indies. I understand moreover,
upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for
England, and other ventures he hath squandered abroad.
