    Therefore the poetDid feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floodsSince naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,But music for the time doth change his nature.The man that hath no music in himself,Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils.The motions of his spirit are dull as night,And his affections dark as Erebus.Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.That light we see is burning in my hall.How far that little candle throws his beams!So shines a good deed in a naughty world.When the moon shone we did not see the candle.So doth the greater glory dim the less.A substitute shines brightly as a kingUntil a king be by, and then his stateEmpties itself, as doth an inland brookInto the main of waters. Music, hark.It is your music, madam, of the house.Nothing is good, I see, without respect.Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.The crow doth sing as sweetly as the larkWhen neither is attended, and I thinkThe nightingale, if she should sing by dayWhen every goose is cackling, would be thoughtNo better a musician than the wren.How many things by season seasoned areTo their right praise and true perfection!Peace! How the moon sleeps with EndymionAnd would not be awaked.#LBSFORGOLDtrees, stones, and rivers come to him by playing music. There’s nothing in the
        world that can resist music. The man who can’t be moved by the harmonious melodies
        is fit only for treason, violence, and pillage. His soul is as dull as night and dark as the
        underworld. Nobody like that should be trusted. Pay attention to the music.That light we see is coming from my hall. Look how far that little candle sends its
        light! That’s the way a good deed shines in a naughty world.While the moon was shining we didn’t even notice the candle.Well, brighter lights always dim the smaller ones. A governor shines as brightly as a
        king until a king is near by, and the governor suddenly looks like a nobody. Music,
       listen!It’s your music, madam, from your house.Now I see that you can’t call anything good except in right context. I think
        that music sounds much better at night than it does during the day.The night’s silence makes it sound better.The crow sings as well as the lark when no one’s listening. If the nightingale
        sang during the day, when every goose is honking, nobody would think it sang any better than
        a wren. How many things in life seem good to us because of when they happen! Quiet now! Look
        how the moon seems to be sleeping with its lover and can’t be awoken!
