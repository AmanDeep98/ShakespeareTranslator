And look what notes and garments he doth give thee,Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speedUnto the traject, to the common ferryWhich trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,But get thee gone. I shall be there before thee.Madam, I go with all convenient speed.Come on, Nerissa, I have work in handThat you yet know not of. We’ll see our husbandsBefore they think of us.    Shall they see us?They shall, Nerissa, but in such a habitThat they shall think we are accomplishèdWith that we lack. I’ll hold thee any wager,When we are both accoutred like young men,I’ll prove the prettier fellow of the two,And wear my dagger with the braver grace,And speak between the change of man and boyWith a reed voice, and turn two mincing stepsInto a manly stride, and speak of fraysLike a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,How honorable ladies sought my love,Which I denying, they fell sick and died—I could not do withal!—Then I’ll repentAnd wish for all that, that I had not killed them.And twenty of these puny lies I’ll tell,That men shall swear I have discontinued schoolAbove a twelvemonth. I have within my mindA thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacksWhich I will practice.#LBSFORGOLDAnd as quickly as possible, take whatever letters and clothes he gives you to the
        public ferry that goes back and forth to Venice. Don’t waste time talking now. Just
        go. I’ll meet you at the ferry.I’ll go as fast as I can, madam.Come on, Nerissa, I have many things to do that you don’t even know about yet.
        We’ll see our husbands before they even have a chance to miss us.Will they see us?They will, Nerissa, but we’ll be disguised as men. I’ll bet you
        anything that I’ll be handsomer than you when we’re both dressed up.
        I’ll wear my sword more gracefully, and speak like a teenage boy, and walk with a
        manly stride rather than my ladylike steps. I’ll talk about fights like a bragging
        youth, and I’ll tell cute lies about honorable ladies who fell in love with me and
        got sick and died when I rejected them. They just died, what could I do! Then I’ll
        start feeling sorry for them, wishing I hadn’t killed them. I’ll tell
        twenty lies like that, so men will think I graduated from school at least a year ago. I know
        a thousand immature tricks like that, and I’ll use them all.
