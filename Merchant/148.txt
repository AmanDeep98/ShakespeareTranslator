    For mine own part,I have toward heaven breathed a secret vowTo live in prayer and contemplation,Only attended by Nerissa hereUntil her husband and my lord’s return.There is a monastery two miles off,And there will we abide. I do desire youNot to deny this imposition,The which my love and some necessityNow lays upon you.    Madam, with all my heart.I shall obey you in all fair commands.My people do already know my mindAnd will acknowledge you and JessicaIn place of Lord Bassanio and myself.So fare you well till we shall meet again.Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!I wish your ladyship all heart’s content.I thank you for your wish, and am well pleasedTo wish it back on you. Fare you well, Jessica.Now, Balthazar,As I have ever found thee honest true,So let me find thee still.
