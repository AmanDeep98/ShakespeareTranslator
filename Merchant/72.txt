Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.—What, Jessica!—Thou shalt not gormandizeAs thou hast done with me.—What, Jessica!—And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out—Why, Jessica, I say!   Why, Jessica!Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.Your worship was wont to tell me that I could do nothing
without bidding.
Call you? What is your will?I am bid forth to supper, Jessica.There are my keys.—But wherefore should I go?I am not bid for love. They flatter me.But yet I’ll go in hate to feed uponThe prodigal Christian.—Jessica, my girl,Look to my house. I am right loath to go.There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,For I did dream of money bags tonight.#LBSFORGOLDWell, you’ll see it with your own eyes. You’ll see the difference
        between working for Shylock and working for
        Bassanio.—(calling for his daughter)
        Jessica!—You won’t eat like a pig like you used to do at my
        place.—Jessica!—And sleep, and snore, and wear your clothes
        out.—Jessica, I’m calling you!Jessica!Who asked you to call her? I’m not asking you to call her.You always loved to tell me I couldn’t do anything without being told.Did you call me? Do you need something?I’ve been invited to supper, Jessica. Here are my keys.—But why
        should I go? I wasn’t invited because they like me. They’re just
        flattering me. But I’ll go out of spite, to feed off the wasteful
        Christian.—Jessica, my girl, watch the house. I don’t feel like going.
        Things aren’t going my way right now. I know because I dreamed of money bags last
        night.
