     Nay, but hear me.Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swearI never more will break an oath with thee.I once did lend my body for his wealth,Which but for him that had your husband’s ringHad quite miscarried. I dare be bound again,My soul upon the forfeit, that your lordWill never more break faith advisedly.
(giving ANTONIO a ring)
Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,And bid him keep it better than the other.
(giving BASSANIO
        PORTIA's ring)
Here, Lord Bassanio. Swear to keep this ring.By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!I had it of him. Pardon me, Bassanio,For by this ring, the doctor lay with me.
(taking out a ring)
And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,For that same scrubbèd boy, the doctor’s clerk,In lieu of this, last night did lie with me.Why, this is like the mending of highwaysIn summer where the ways are fair enough!What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?#LBSFORGOLDNo, just listen to me. If you forgive my mistake, I swear I’ll never break an
        oath with you again.I lent my body once to make him rich. If it hadn’t been for the gentleman who
        now owns your husband’s ring, my body would’ve been lost. I’d be
        the guarantee again, promising my soul this time as penalty, if your husband ever breaks a
        vow again knowingly.
(she gives ANTONIO
        a ring) Then you’ll be my guarantee. Give him this.
        And tell him to hold on to it better than the other one.
(he gives BASSANIO
        PORTIA’s ring) Here, Bassanio, swear that
        you’ll keep this ring.My God, it’s the same one I gave the judge!I got it from him. I’m sorry, Bassanio, but the legal expert slept with me in
        exchange for this ring.   
(she takes out a ring) And I’m sorry too,
        Gratiano, but that stunted lawyer’s clerk slept with me last night in exchange for
        this ring.This is like fixing roads in the summer when they don’t need to be fixed!
        What, did you cheat on us before we deserved it?
