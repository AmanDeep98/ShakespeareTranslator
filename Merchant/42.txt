Mislike me not for my complexion,The shadowed livery of the burnished sun,To whom I am a neighbor and near bred.Bring me the fairest creature northward born,Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,And let us make incision for your loveTo prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mineHath feared the valiant. By my love I swearThe best-regarded virgins of our climeHave loved it too. I would not change this hueExcept to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.In terms of choice I am not solely ledBy nice direction of a maiden’s eyes.Besides, the lottery of my destinyBars me the right of voluntary choosing.But if my father had not scanted meAnd hedged me by his wit to yield myselfHis wife who wins me by that means I told you,Yourself, renownèd Prince, then stood as fairAs any comer I have looked on yetFor my affection.#LBSFORGOLDDon’t hold my skin color against me. I was born and raised in the sun, which
        is why I’m dark-skinned. But I’m as red-blooded as any man. Show me the
        best-looking person born in the freezing north, where the sun barely thaws the icicles.
        I’ll win your love by cutting myself to prove to you I have redder blood than he
        does. I’m telling you, madam, my skin color has made brave men fear me and Moroccan
        girls love me. I wouldn’t change it except to make you think of me, my darling
        queen.Being good-looking isn’t the only way to my heart, you know. I have other
        criteria for choosing a husband. Not that it matters, because the box test takes away my
        free choice anyway. But if my father hadn’t restricted me like
        this—forcing me to marry whoever wins his test—then you’d
        have had as good a chance to marry me as any of the suitors I’ve met so far,
        prince.
