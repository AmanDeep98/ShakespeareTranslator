    My wind cooling my brothWould blow me to an ague when I thoughtWhat harm a wind too great at sea might do.I should not see the sandy hourglass run,But I should think of shallows and of flatsAnd see my wealthy Andrew docked in sand,Vailing her high top lower than her ribsTo kiss her burial. Should I go to churchAnd see the holy edifice of stoneAnd not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,Which, touching but my gentle vessel’s side,Would scatter all her spices on the stream,Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,And, in a word, but even now worth this,And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thoughtTo think on this, and shall I lack the thoughtThat such a thing bechanced would make me sad?But tell not me. I know AntonioIs sad to think upon his merchandise.Believe me, no. I thank my fortune for it—My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,Nor to one place, nor is my whole estateUpon the fortune of this present year.Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.Why then, you are in love.    Fie, fie!Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sadBecause you are not merry—and ’twere as easyFor you to laugh and leap and say you are merryBecause you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time.#LBSFORGOLDI’d get scared every time I blew on my soup to cool it, thinking of how a
        strong wind could wipe out my ships. Every time I glanced at the sand in an hourglass
        I’d imagine my ships wrecked on sandbars. I’d think of dangerous rocks
        every time I went to church and saw the stones it was made of. If my ship brushed up against
        rocks like that, its whole cargo of spices would be dumped into the sea. All of its silk
        shipments would be sent flying into the roaring waters. In one moment I’d go
        bankrupt. Who wouldn’t get sad thinking about things like that? It’s
        obvious. Antonio is sad because he’s so worried about his cargo.No, that’s not it, trust me. Thankfully my financial situation is healthy. I
        don’t have all of my money invested in one ship, or one part of the world. If I
        don’t do well this year, I’ll still be okay. So it’s not my
        business that’s making me sad.Well then, you must be in love.Oh, give me a break.You’re not in love either? Fine, let’s just say you’re sad
        because you’re not in a good mood. You know, it’d be just as easy for you
        to laugh and dance around and say you’re in a good mood. You could just say
        you’re not sad. Humans are so different.
