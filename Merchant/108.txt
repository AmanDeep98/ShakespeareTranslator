How now, Shylock? What news among the merchants?You knew—none so well, none so well as you—of my
daughter’s flight.
That’s certain. I, for my part, knew the tailor that made
the wings she flew withal.
And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged,
and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam.
She is damned for it.That’s certain—if the devil may be her judge.My own flesh and blood to rebel!Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years?I say my daughter is my flesh and blood.There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than
between jet and ivory, more between your bloods than
there is between red wine and rhenish. But tell us, do you
hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no?
#LBSFORGOLDHow’s it going, Shylock? What’s the news among the merchants?You knew—no one knew, no one knew as well as you did—about my
        daughter’s plans to run away.That’s true. I even knew the tailor who made the disguise she wore when she
        ran off.And Shylock knew his daughter was ready to run away. It’s natural for children
        to leave their parents.She’ll be damned for it.That’s true—if the devil’s judging her.My own flesh and blood turned against me! A rebel!No! Your flesh still rebelsSolanio pretends to think Shylock means he can’t control his own sexual urges.flesh still rebels at your age?I mean my daughter is my flesh and blood.You two are totally different. Your flesh is more different from hers than coal is from
        ivory. There’s more difference between your bloods than between red wine and white.
        But tell us, did you hear anything about Antonio’s loss at sea?
