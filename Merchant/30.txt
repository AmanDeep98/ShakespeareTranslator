Which he calls “interest.” Cursèd be my tribeIf I forgive him!Shylock, do you hear?I am debating of my present store,And by the near guess of my memoryI cannot instantly raise up the grossOf full three thousand ducats. What of that?Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,Will furnish me. But soft! How many monthsDo you desire?
(to ANTONIO)
   Rest you fair, good signor.Your worship was the last man in our mouths.Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrowBy taking nor by giving of excess,Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,I’ll break a custom.
(to BASSANIO)
   Is he yet possessedHow much ye would?Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.And for three months.I had forgot—three months.
(to BASSANIO)
    You told me so.
(to ANTONIO)
Well then, your bond, and let me see—But hear you,Methought you said you neither lend nor borrowUpon advantage.#LBSFORGOLDIt would an insult to Jews everywhere to forgive that man!Shylock, are you listening?I’m thinking about how much cash I have on hand. If I remember correctly, I
        can’t raise the entire three thousand ducats immediately. But so what? Tubal, a
        wealthy Jew I know, will supply me with the cash. But wait a minute! How many months do you
        want? (to ANTONIO) Oh, hello,
        how are you, signor? We were just talking about you.Shylock, although I never lend or borrow with interest, I’m willing to break
        that habit to help a friend in need. (to
        BASSANIO) Does he know how much you need?Oh yes, three thousand ducats.For three months.Yes, I forgot—three months. (to
        BASSANIO) You told me that.
        (to ANTONIO) Now then, about
        your guarantee. Let me see—but listen, Antonio, I thought you said you
        don’t lend or borrow with interest.
