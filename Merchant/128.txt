A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave,I come by note to give and to receive.Like one of two contending in a prizeThat thinks he hath done well in people’s eyes,Hearing applause and universal shout,Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubtWhether these pearls of praise be his or no—So, thrice fair lady, stand I even so,As doubtful whether what I see be trueUntil confirmed, signed, ratified by you.You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I standSuch as I am. Though for myself aloneI would not be ambitious in my wishTo wish myself much better, yet for youI would be trebled twenty times myself—A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich—That only to stand high in your accountI might in virtue, beauties, livings, friendsExceed account. But the full sum of meIs sum of something which, to term in gross,Is an unlessoned girl, unschooled, unpracticèd;Happy in this—she is not yet so oldBut she may learn. Happier than this—She is not bred so dull but she can learn.Happiest of all is that her gentle spiritCommits itself to yours to be directedAs from her lord, her governor, her king.Myself and what is mine to you and yoursIs now converted. But now I was the lordOf this fair mansion, master of my servants,Queen o'er myself. And even now, but now,This house, these servants, and this same myselfAre yours, my lord’s. I give them with this ring,Which when you part from, lose, or give away,Let it presage the ruin of your love#LBSFORGOLDA nice message. My lady, with your permission, this note authorizes me to give myself
        to you with a kiss. But I’m in a daze, like someone who’s just won a
        contest and thinks that all the applause and cheering is for him, but isn’t sure
        yet. And so, beautiful lady, I’m standing here just like that, wondering whether
        all this can be true until you tell me it is.You see me standing here, Lord Bassanio. What you see is what you get. Though I
        wouldn’t wish to be better for my own sake, for your sake I wish I were twenty
        times more than myself—a thousand times more beautiful and ten thousand times
        richer—just so you might value me more, so my good qualities, beauty,
        possessions, and friends would be more than you could calculate. What you’re
        getting is an innocent and inexperienced girl. I’m happy that at least I’m
        not too old to learn new things. I’m even happier that I’m not stupid, and
        I can learn. I’m happiest of all that I’m yours now, my lord, my king, and
        you can guide me as you wish. Everything I am and everything I have now belongs to you. Just
        a minute ago I was the owner of this beautiful mansion, master of these servants, and queen
        over myself. But as of right this second all these things are yours. With this ring I give
        them all to you.
