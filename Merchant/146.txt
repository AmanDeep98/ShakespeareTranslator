Madam, although I speak it in your presence,You have a noble and a true conceitOf godlike amity, which appears most stronglyIn bearing thus the absence of your lord.But if you knew to whom you show this honor,How true a gentleman you send relief,How dear a lover of my lord your husband,I know you would be prouder of the workThan customary bounty can enforce you.I never did repent for doing good,Nor shall not now; for in companionsThat do converse and waste the time togetherWhose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,There must be needs a like proportionOf lineaments, of manners, and of spirit,Which makes me think that this Antonio,Being the bosom lover of my lord,Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,How little is the cost I have bestowedIn purchasing the semblance of my soulFrom out the state of hellish cruelty!This comes too near the praising of myself.Therefore no more of it. Hear other things.Lorenzo, I commit into your handsThe husbandry and manage of my houseUntil my lord’s return.#LBSFORGOLDMadam, I hope you don’t mind my saying that I admire your noble respect for
        friendship, which you show in letting your husband go off to help his friend like this. If
        you only knew the man you’re helping out, and what a faithful gentleman he is and
        how much he loves your husband, I know you’d be even prouder of your kindness than
        you normally might be.I’ve never regretted doing good, and I don’t now. Friends who spend a
        lot of time together and really care equally for each other must have many traits in common.
        Since Antonio’s my husband’s best friend, they must be very similar men.
        In that case, the money I’ve sent is a small price to pay to rescue someone who
        resembles my Bassanio, who’s like my own soul.—Anyway, let’s
        change the subject, since I feel like I’m starting to flatter myself. I have a
        favor to ask of you. Lorenzo, please take charge of the management of my house until my
        husband comes back.
