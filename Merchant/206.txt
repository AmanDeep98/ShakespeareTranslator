    In such a nightDid Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew,And with an unthrift love did run from VeniceAs far as Belmont.   In such a nightDid young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,And ne'er a true one.    In such a nightDid pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,Slander her love, and he forgave it her.I would outnight you, did nobody come.But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.Who comes so fast in silence of the night?A friend.A friend? What friend? Your name, I pray you, friend?Stephano is my name, and I bring wordMy mistress will before the break of dayBe here at Belmont. She doth stray aboutBy holy crosses, where she kneels and praysFor happy wedlock hours.    Who comes with her?#LBSFORGOLDOn a night like this, Jessica ran away from the wealthy Jew and stole his money. She
        ran away from Venice all the way to Belmont with her spendthrift lover.On a night like this, young Lorenzo swore he loved her very much, stealing her heart
        with vows of love, but not one vow was true.On a night like this, pretty Jessica, in a bad mood, said outrageously wrong things
        about her lover, and he forgave her.I’d get the better of you in this storytelling game, but somebody’s
        coming. I hear his footsteps.Who are you, coming so fast in this quiet night?A friend.A friend? What friend? What’s your name, please, friend?My name’s Stephano, and I’ve come to tell you my mistress will arrive
        here at Belmont before sunrise. She’s still at the monastery, kneeling and praying
        for a happy marriage.Who’s coming with her?
