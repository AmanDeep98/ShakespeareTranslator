(he gives PORTIA
        BASSANIO’s ring) Sir, you’re lucky I caught
        up with you. Bassanio thought about it some more and sent this ring to you. He would like to
        invite you to dinner.I can’t have dinner with him. Please tell him I accept his ring with thanks.
        And could you please take my servant to old Shylock’s house?I’ll do that.

        speak with you? (speaking so that only
        PORTIAcan hear) I’ll see if I can get my
        husband’s ring, which I made him swear to keep forever.

        we’ll deny it and outswear them too.—
