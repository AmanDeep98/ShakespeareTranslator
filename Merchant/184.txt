Grieve not that I am fall'n to this for you,For herein Fortune shows herself more kindThan is her custom. It is still her useTo let the wretched man outlive his wealth,To view with hollow eye and wrinkled browAn age of poverty—from which lingering penanceOf such misery doth she cut me off.Commend me to your honorable wife.Tell her the process of Antonio’s end.Say how I loved you. Speak me fair in death.And when the tale is told, bid her be judgeWhether Bassanio had not once a love.Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,And he repents not that he pays your debt.For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,I’ll pay it presently with all my heart.Antonio, I am married to a wifeWhich is as dear to me as life itself.But life itself, my wife, and all the worldAre not with me esteemed above thy life.I would lose all—ay, sacrifice them allHere to this devil—to deliver you.Your wife would give you little thanks for thatIf she were by to hear you make the offer.I have a wife, whom I protest I love.I would she were in heaven, so she couldEntreat some power to change this currish Jew.'Tis well you offer it behind her back.The wish would make else an unquiet house.#LBSFORGOLDDon’t be sad that this happened because of you, because Lady Luck’s
        been nicer to me than usual. Usually she makes the unhappy man live on after he loses his
        wealth, to spend his old age in poverty. But in my case she’s letting me avoid that
        misery. Send your honorable wife my greetings, and tell her how I died and how I loved you.
        Speak well of me after I’m dead, and when the tale’s done, ask her to
        judge whether Bassanio had a friend. Be sad only at the fact that you’ll lose your
        friend—your friend doesn’t regret that he paid your debt. If the Jew
        cuts deep enough, I’ll pay it instantly with all my heart.Antonio, I married a woman as dear to me as life itself. But life itself, my wife, and
        the whole world aren’t more valuable to me than your life is. I’d give it
        all up—yes, I’d sacrifice them all to this devil here—to
        save you.Your wife wouldn’t like it if she were here to hear you make that
       offer.I have a wife I love. I wish she were in heaven so she could appeal to some power to
        make this dog Jew change his mind.It’s nice you’re offering to sacrifice her behind her back. That wish
        of yours could start quite an argument back at home.
