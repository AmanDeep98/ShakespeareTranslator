This is the penthouse under which LorenzoDesired us to make stand.    His hour is almost past.And it is marvel he outdwells his hour,For lovers ever run before the clock.Oh, ten times faster Venus' pigeons flyTo seal love’s bonds new made than they are wontTo keep obligèd faith unforfeited.That ever holds. Who riseth from a feastWith that keen appetite that he sits down?Where is the horse that doth untread againHis tedious measures with the unbated fireThat he did pace them first? All things that are,Are with more spirit chasèd than enjoyed.How like a younger or a prodigalThe scarfèd bark puts from her native bay,Hugged and embraèd by the strumpet wind!How like the prodigal doth she return,With overweathered ribs and ragged sailsLean, rent, and beggared by the strumpet wind!Here comes Lorenzo. More of this hereafter.#LBSFORGOLDThis is the roof under which Lorenzo said to meet him.He’s late.Yes, and that’s surprising, because lovers are usually early.Yes, for new lovers time passes ten times faster than for couples who’ve been
        married forever.That’s always true. Who gets up from a meal with the same appetite he had when
        he sat down? Can any horse retrace his footsteps with the same energy he had when he walked
        them the first time? We chase everything in life more excitedly than we actually enjoy it
        when we get it. It’s like when a ship sails out of the harbor with all its flags
        waving, gently pushed by the wind. When that ship returns, her timber is all weather-beaten
        and her sails are ragged. That same wind makes the ship thin and poor.Here comes Lorenzo. We’ll talk about this later.
