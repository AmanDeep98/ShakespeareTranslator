Yes, other men have ill luck too. Antonio, as I heard inGenoa—What, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck?Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.I thank God, I thank God! Is ’t true, is ’t true?I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack.I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news! Ha, ha,
heard in Genoa.
Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one night
fourscore ducats.
Thou stickest a dagger in me. I shall never see my gold
again. Fourscore ducats at a sitting! Fourscore ducats!
There came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my company
to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break.
I am very glad of it. I’ll plague him. I’ll torture him. I am
glad of it.
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your
daughter for a monkey.
Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my
turquoise. I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor. I would
not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.
#LBSFORGOLDWell, other men have bad luck too. Antonio, as I heard in Genoa—What, what, what? Bad luck, bad luck?He’s had a ship wrecked coming from Tripolis.Thank God, thank God! Is it true, is it true?I spoke with some of the sailors who survived the wreck.Thank you, Tubal. Good news, good news! Ha, ha, heard in Genoa.I also heard that your daughter spent eighty ducats in Genoa one night.Oh, you’re sticking a dagger in me! I’ll never see my gold again.
        Eighty ducats in one shot! Eighty ducats!I came to Venice with a number of Antonio’s creditors who say he
        won’t be able to avoid going bankrupt.I’m very glad about that. I’ll hound him. I’ll torture him.
        I’m very glad.One creditor showed me a ring he got from your daughter in exchange for a
       monkey.Damn her! You’re torturing me, Tubal. That was my turquoise ring! Leah gave it
        to me before we were married. I wouldn’t have given it away for a whole jungle of
        monkeys.
