Quick, quick, I pray thee. Draw the curtain straight.The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oathAnd comes to his election presently.Behold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince.If you choose that wherein I am contained,Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized.But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,You must be gone from hence immediately.I am enjoined by oath to observe three things:First, never to unfold to any oneWhich casket ’twas I chose; next, if I failOf the right casket, never in my lifeTo woo a maid in way of marriage; lastly,If I do fail in fortune of my choice,Immediately to leave you and be gone.To these injunctions every one doth swearThat comes to hazard for my worthless self.And so have I addressed me. Fortune nowTo my heart’s hope! Gold, silver, and base lead.“Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.”You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.What says the golden chest?

        Second, if I choose the wrong box, I’ll never propose marriage for the rest of my
