Make room, and let him stand before our face.—Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,That thou but lead’st this fashion of thy maliceTo the last hour of act, and then ’tis thoughtThou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strangeThan is thy strange apparent cruelty,And where thou now exacts the penalty—Which is a pound of this poor merchant’s flesh—Thou wilt not only loose the forfeitureBut—touched with human gentleness and love,—Forgive a moiety of the principal,Glancing an eye of pity on his lossesThat have of late so huddled on his backEno' to press a royal merchant downAnd pluck commiseration of his stateFrom brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,From stubborn Turks and Tartars never trainedTo offices of tender courtesy.We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.I have possessed your grace of what I purpose,And by our holy Sabbath have I swornTo have the due and forfeit of my bond.If you deny it, let the danger lightUpon your charter and your city’s freedom.You’ll ask me why I rather choose to haveA weight of carrion flesh than to receiveThree thousand ducats. I’ll not answer thatBut say it is my humour. Is it answered?What if my house be troubled with a ratAnd I be pleased to give ten thousand ducatsTo have it baned? What, are you answered yet?#LBSFORGOLDMake room so he can stand in front of me. Shylock, everyone thinks—and I
        agree—that you’re just pretending to be cruel. They think that at the
        last second you’re going to show mercy and pity, which will be more surprising than
        the bizarre cruelty that you seem to be showing now. And even though you’re here to
        collect the penalty—a pound of this poor merchant’s
        flesh—they think you’ll not only let it go, but out of humanity and
        love you’ll forgive some portion of the principal he owes you too. In doing so
        you’ll be taking pity on him for his many recent losses, which have been large
        enough to send even the greatest merchant out of business, and make even the most
        hard-hearted Turk or Tartar feel sorry for him. What do you say? We all expect a nice answer
        from you, Jew.I’ve told you what I intend to do, and I’ve sworn by the holy Sabbath
        to seek the penalty that is due according to our contract. If you refuse to allow me to do
        so, your city’s charter and its freedom are endangered. You’re going to
        ask me why I’d rather have a pound of decaying flesh than three thousand ducats. I
        won’t answer that. Let’s just say it’s because I feel like it. Is
        that enough of an answer? What if I had a rat in my house, and I felt like paying ten
        thousand ducats to have it exterminated? Do you have your answer yet?
