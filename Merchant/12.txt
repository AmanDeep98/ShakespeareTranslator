Is to come fairly off from the great debtsWherein my time something too prodigalHath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,I owe the most in money and in love,And from your love I have a warrantyTo unburden all my plots and purposesHow to get clear of all the debts I owe.I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it.And if it stand, as you yourself still do,Within the eye of honor, be assuredMy purse, my person, my extremest meansLie all unlocked to your occasions.In my school days, when I had lost one shaft,I shot his fellow of the selfsame flightThe selfsame way with more advisèd watchTo find the other forth—and by adventuring both,I oft found both. I urge this childhood proofBecause what follows is pure innocence.I owe you much, and, like a willful youth,That which I owe is lost. But if you pleaseTo shoot another arrow that self wayWhich you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,As I will watch the aim, or to find bothOr bring your latter hazard back againAnd thankfully rest debtor for the first.You know me well, and herein spend but timeTo wind about my love with circumstance.And out of doubt you do me now more wrongIn making question of my uttermostThan if you had made waste of all I have.Then do but say to me what I should doThat in your knowledge may by me be done,And I am pressed unto it. Therefore speak.#LBSFORGOLDI just want to be honorable and pay off the big debts that piled up when I was living
        the high life. I’m in debt to many people, and I owe most to you,
        Antonio—both money and gratitude. And because you care about me, I know
        you’ll let me tell you my plan to clear all my debts.Please let me know your plan, Bassanio. As long as it’s honorable, you can be
        sure that I’ll let you use all my money and do everything I can to help you.Back when I was a schoolboy, if I lost an arrow I would try to find it by shooting
        another arrow in the same direction, watching the second arrow more carefully than I had the
        first. By risking the second arrow, I’d often get both of them back. I’m
        telling you this story for a reason. I owe you a lot, and like a spoiled kid I’ve
        lost what I owe you. But if you’d be willing to shoot another arrow the same way
        you shot the first, I’ll watch your arrow more carefully this time. Either
        we’ll get back all the money I owe you, or else we’ll get back what you
        lend me this time, and I’ll just owe you what I already owe you.You know me better than that. You’re wasting your breath. All of this talk
        means you have doubts about my friendship. That’s worse than if you bankrupted me.
        Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it. Tell me.
