The moon shines bright. In such a night as this,When the sweet wind did gently kiss the treesAnd they did make no noise, in such a nightTroilus methinks mounted the Trojan wallsAnd sighed his soul toward the Grecian tentsWhere Cressid lay that night.     In such a nightDid Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dewAnd saw the lion’s shadow ere himselfAnd ran dismayed away.    In such a nightStood Dido with a willow in her handUpon the wild sea banks, and waft her loveTo come again to Carthage.    In such a nightMedea gathered the enchanted herbsThat did renew old Æson.#LBSFORGOLDThe moon’s bright tonight.
