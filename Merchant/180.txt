Here ’tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.Shylock, there’s thrice thy money offered thee.An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven.Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?No, not for Venice.    Why, this bond is forfeit!And lawfully by this the Jew may claimA pound of flesh to be by him cut offNearest the merchant’s heart.—Be merciful.Take thrice thy money. Bid me tear the bond.When it is paid according to the tenor.It doth appear you are a worthy judge.You know the law. Your expositionHath been most sound. I charge you by the law,Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,Proceed to judgment. By my soul I swearThere is no power in the tongue of manTo alter me.

(he hands PORTIA a paper)
        Here it is, judge, here it is.Shylock, they’re offering you three times the money you lent.But I made an oath, an oath, an oath in heaven. Should I perjure my soul by disobeying
        it? No, not for all of Venice.The money wasn’t paid back! And so the Jew may lawfully claim a pound of flesh
        nearest the merchant’s heart, to be cut off by him.—But please have
        mercy. Take three times your money. Tell me to tear up this contract.I’ll tear it up when it’s paid. You seem like a good judge. You know
        the law. Your explanation has made sense. I urge you to deliver your verdict. I swear that
        nothing anyone can say will change my mind. I’m sticking to the contract.I beg the court to deliver the verdict.Well, then, here it is: you must prepare yourself for his knife.Oh, good judge! Oh, you excellent young man!
