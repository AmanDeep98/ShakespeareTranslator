He shall do this, or else I do recantThe pardon that I late pronouncèd here.Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?I am content.
(to NERISSA)
   Clerk, draw a deed of gift.I pray you, give me leave to go from hence.I am not well. Send the deed after me,And I will sign it.   Get thee gone, but do it.
(to SHYLOCK)
In christening shalt thou have two godfathers.Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more—To bring thee to the gallows, not to the font.
(to PORTIA) Sir, I
        entreat you home with me to dinner.I humbly do desire your grace of pardon.I must away this night toward Padua,And it is meet I presently set forth.I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.—Antonio, gratify this gentleman,For in my mind you are much bound to him.#LBSFORGOLDHe must do this, or I’ll recant the pardon I just delivered.Are you satisfied, Jew? What do you say?I’m satisfied.
(to NERISSA) Clerk, draw
        up a document to make his gift official.Please let me go. I’m not well. Send the deed after me and I’ll sign
        it.Go, but sign the deed.
(to SHYLOCK) When
        you’re baptized a Christian, you’ll have two godfathers. If I’d
        been the judge, you would’ve had ten more—twelve jurors to sentence you
        to death rather than baptism.
(to PORTIA) Sir, please
        come home with me to dinner.I’m very sorry, sir, but I have to go to Padua tonight. I should really leave
        right away.I’m sorry you don’t have time.—Antonio, give this
        gentleman a reward. In my opinion, you owe him a lot.
