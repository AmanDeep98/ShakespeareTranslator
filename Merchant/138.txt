     Not one, my lord.Besides, it should appear that if he hadThe present money to discharge the Jew,He would not take it. Never did I knowA creature that did bear the shape of manSo keen and greedy to confound a man.He plies the duke at morning and at night,And doth impeach the freedom of the stateIf they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,The duke himself, and the magnificoesOf greatest port have all persuaded with him.But none can drive him from the envious pleaOf forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.When I was with him I have heard him swearTo Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,That he would rather have Antonio’s fleshThan twenty times the value of the sumThat he did owe him. And I know, my lord,If law, authority, and power deny not,It will go hard with poor Antonio.Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,The best conditioned and unwearied spiritIn doing courtesies, and one in whomThe ancient Roman honor more appearsThan any that draws breath in Italy.What sum owes he the Jew?For me, three thousand ducats.#LBSFORGOLDNot one, my lord. Anyway, even if he had the money now, the Jew probably
        wouldn’t take it. I’ve never seen a creature with a human shape who was so
        eager to destroy a man. He’s at the duke’s morning and night, accusing the
        state of harming free trade if they deny him justice. Twenty merchants, the duke himself,
        and the highest-ranking Venetian nobles have all tried to persuade him to forget his
        contract, but nobody can do it. He’s determined to get the penalty specified in his
        contract with Antonio.When I was still living with him I heard him swear to Tubal and Cush, his countrymen,
        that he’d rather have Antonio’s flesh than twenty times the sum Antonio
        owed. And I know that unless the law intervenes, it’ll be bad news for poor
        Antonio.Is this your good friend who’s in so much trouble?Yes, he’s my best friend, the kindest man and most courteous to others.
        He’s more honorable than anyone else in Italy.How much does he owe the Jew?Three thousand ducats.
