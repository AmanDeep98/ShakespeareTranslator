What says that fool of Hagar’s offspring, ha?His words were, “Farewell, mistress.” Nothing else.The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder,Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by dayMore than the wildcat. Drones hive not with me.Therefore I part with him, and part with himTo one that would have him help to wasteHis borrowed purse. Well, Jessica, go in.Perhaps I will return immediately.Do as I bid you. Shut doors after you.Fast bind, fast find.A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.Farewell, and if my fortune be not crost,I have a father, you a daughter, lost.#LBSFORGOLDWhat did that gentile fool say to you, hmmm?He said “Goodbye, madam,” and nothing else.The fool’s nice enough, but he’s such a huge eater, and slow as a
        snail when he works. He sleeps all day like a cat. Bees that don’t work
        can’t stay in my hive, so I’m letting him go, handing him off so he can
        waste money for his new boss, the man who borrowed money from me. Anyway, Jessica, go
        inside. I might come back soon. Do as I told you. Shut the doors after you. As the saying
        goes, lock things up, and you’ll get to keep them.Goodbye. If luck’s with me, I’ll lose a father, and you’ll
        lose a daughter.
