To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,Thou makest thy knife keen. But no metal can—No, not the hangman’s axe—bear half the keennessOf thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.O, be thou damned, inexecrable dog,And for thy life let justice be accused!Thou almost makest me waver in my faithTo hold opinion with PythagorasThat souls of animals infuse themselvesInto the trunks of men. Thy currish spiritGoverned a wolf who, hanged for human slaughter,Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,And whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed damInfused itself in thee, for thy desiresAre wolvish, bloody, starved, and ravenous.Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,Thou but offend’st thy lungs to speak so loud.Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fallTo cureless ruin. I stand here for law.This letter from Bellario doth commendA young and learnèd doctor to our court.Where is he?   He attendeth here hard byTo know your answer whether you’ll admit him.#LBSFORGOLDTo cut my penalty from that bankrupt man over there.You’re sharpening that knife not on your sole but on your soul, you cruel Jew.
        No metal—not even the executioner’s axe—could ever be half
        as sharp as your hatred. Can’t any prayers reach your heart?No, none that you’re smart enough to make.Oh, you’re going to hell, you disgusting dog. Killing you would be justice.
        You almost make me forget that I’m a Christian. You make me want to agree with the
        philosopher Pythagoras that animal souls are reincarnated in human bodies. Your vicious dog
        soul used to belong to a wolf that was killed for slaughtering humans. When he died, his
        cruel soul passed out of his body and went into yours while you were lying in your unholy
        mother’s womb. That’s why your desires are wolfish, bloody, and
       ravenous.Unless your taunts can undo the signature on my contract, you’re just wearing
        out your lungs by speaking so loud. Be quiet, boy, or you’ll lose your mind. I
        stand here with the law on my side.This letter from Bellario introduces us to a young and well-educated legal expert.
        Where is he?He’s waiting nearby to find out if you’ll invite him in.
