He hath refused it in the open court.He shall have merely justice and his bond.A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!—I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.Shall I not have barely my principal?Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeitureTo be so taken at thy peril, Jew.Why then, the devil give him good of it!I’ll stay no longer question.    Tarry, Jew.The law hath yet another hold on you.It is enacted in the laws of Venice,If it be proved against an alienThat by direct or indirect attemptsHe seek the life of any citizen,The party 'gainst the which he doth contriveShall seize one half his goods. The other halfComes to the privy coffer of the state,And the offender’s life lies in the mercyOf the Duke only 'gainst all other voice.In which predicament I say thou stand’st,For it appears by manifest proceedingThat indirectly—and directly too—Thou hast contrived against the very lifeOf the defendant, and thou hast incurredThe danger formerly by me rehearsed.Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.#LBSFORGOLDNo, he refused it publicly, in open court. He will have only justice and his
       penalty.A Daniel, I keep saying it! A second Daniel!—Thank you, Jew, for teaching
        me that word.I won’t even get the original three thousand ducats back?You can’t have anything but the penalty, to be taken at your peril,
       Jew.Well, then, I hope he chokes on it! I’m not staying here to argue
       anymore.Wait a minute, Jew. The law has another hold on you. The laws of Venice state that if a
        foreign resident directly or indirectly attempts to kill any citizen, the person he tried to
        kill will receive one half of the foreigner’s goods. The other half goes to the
        state. Whether the offending person lives or dies is up to the
        duke—there’s no one else to appeal to. In your predicament
        you’ve earned that punishment, because you’ve clearly contrived
        indirectly—and directly too—to take the life of the defendant. So
        get down on your knees and beg mercy from the duke.
