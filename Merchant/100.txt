“What many men desire”—that
        “many” may be meantBy the fool multitude that choose by show,Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;Which pries not to th' interior, but like the martletBuilds in the weather on the outward wall,Even in the force and road of casualty.I will not choose what many men desireBecause I will not jump with common spiritsAnd rank me with the barbarous multitudes.Why then, to thee, thou silver treasure house.Tell me once more what title thou dost bear.“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”And well said too—for who shall go aboutTo cozen fortune and be honorableWithout the stamp of merit? Let none presumeTo wear an undeservèd dignity.Oh, that estates, degrees and officesWere not derived corruptly, and that clear honorWere purchased by the merit of the wearer!How many then should cover that stand bare!How many be commanded that command!How much low peasantry would then be gleanedFrom the true seed of honor! And how much honorPicked from the chaff and ruin of the timesTo be new varnished! Well, but to my choice.“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”I will assume desert.—Give me a key for this,And instantly unlock my fortunes here.Too long a pause for that which you find there.#LBSFORGOLD“He who chooses me will get what many men want.” What many men
        want—that “many” could mean that most people are fools
        and choose by whatever is flashy. They don’t go beyond what their eyes see. They
        don’t bother to find out what’s on the inside. Just like those birds
        called martins who build their nests on the outside of walls, people pay too much attention
        to what’s on the outside. So I won’t choose what many men desire, because
        I won’t jump on the bandwagon and include myself with the whole crude population.
        So I guess it’s you, you silver treasure house. Tell me once more what you say.
        “He who chooses me will get what he deserves.” That’s
        nicely put—because who’s going to cheat luck and get more than he
        deserves? No one should have an honor he doesn’t deserve. Oh, wouldn’t it
        be great if property, rank, official positions, and other honors were earned only by merit,
        not by corruption? There wouldn’t be too many important men then. How many people
        who are humble now would be great then? How many people who give orders now would have to
        take orders? How many noblemen would be weeded out and would become peasants? And how many
        common people would suddenly shine with nobility? Well, let me get back to my choice.
        “He who chooses me will get what he deserves.” I’ll assume
        I deserve the very best.—Give me a key for this one. I’ll unlock my
        fate here in a second.You thought about it too long, considering what you found there.
