But Antonio is certainly undone.Nay, that’s true, that’s very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an
officer. Bespeak him a fortnight before.—I will have the
heart of him if he forfeit, for were he out of Venice I can
make what merchandise I will.—Go, go, Tubal, and meet

Tubal.
#LBSFORGOLDBut Antonio’s certainly ruined.That’s true, that’s very true. Tubal, go find me a police officer to
        arrest Antonio. Get him ready two weeks ahead of time.—I’ll take
        Antonio’s heart if he can’t pay. With him out of Venice, I can make
        whatever bargains I want when I lend money.—Go, Tubal. Meet me at the
       synagogue.
