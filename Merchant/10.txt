Well, we will leave you then till dinnertime.I must be one of these same dumb wise men,For Gratiano never lets me speak.Well, keep me company but two years more,Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.Farewell. I’ll grow a talker for this gear.Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendableIn a neat’s tongue dried and a maid not vendible.Is that any thing now?Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than
any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of
wheat hid in two bushels of chaff—you shall seek all day
ere you find them, and when you have them they are not
worth the search.
Well, tell me now what lady is the sameTo whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,That you today promised to tell me of?'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,How much I have disabled mine estate,By something showing a more swelling portThan my faint means would grant continuance.Nor do I now make moan to be abridgedFrom such a noble rate. But my chief care#LBSFORGOLDAll right, we’ll see you at dinnertime. I must be one of these silent
        so-called wise men Gratiano’s talking about, because he never lets me get a word
        in.If you hang around me for two more years, you’ll forget the sound of your own
        voice. I won’t ever let you speak.Goodbye. After that lecture of yours, I’ll start talking a lot.Thank you. The only tongues that should be silent are ox-tongues on a dinner plate and
        those that belong to old maids.Is he right?Gratiano talks more nonsense than any other man in Venice. His point is always like a
        needle in a haystack—you look for it all day, and when you find it you realize
        it wasn’t worth the trouble.So, who’s this girl, the one you said you were going to take a special trip
        for? You promised to tell me.Antonio, you know how bad my finances have been lately. I’ve been living way
        beyond my means. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not complaining about having to
        cut back.
