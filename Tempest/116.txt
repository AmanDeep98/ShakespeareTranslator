(aside)     Fair
                                encounterOf two most rare affections! Heavens rain graceOn that which breeds between 'em!Wherefore weep you?At mine unworthiness, that dare not offerWhat I desire to give, and much less takeWhat I shall die to want. But this is trifling,And all the more it seeks to hide itselfThe bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning,And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!I am your wife if you will marry me.If not, I’ll die your maid. To be your fellowYou may deny me, but I’ll be your servantWhether you will or no.My mistress, dearest, and I thus humble ever.My husband, then?Ay, with a heart as willingAs bondage e'er of freedom. Here’s my
                            hand.And mine, with my heart in ’t. And now farewellTill half an hour hence.#LBSFORGOLDdestroy all my prospects in life! More than anything else in the
                                world, I love you, value you, and honor you.Look at me crying—what a fool I am to cry at what makes
                                me happy.

                                meeting between two people truly in love! May heaven bless the
                                feelings growing between them!Why are you crying?I’m crying at how unworthy I am to give you what I want
                                to give you and to take what I’m dying to have. But
                                it’s a waste of time to say so. The more I try to hide
                                what I’m feeling, the bigger it gets. Oh, stop being so
                                bashful and tricky, Miranda, just be straightforward and innocent!
                                I’ll be your wife if you’ll have me.
                                Otherwise, I’ll die a virgin, devoted to you. You can
                                refuse to make me your spouse, but I’ll be your servant
                                whether you want me to or not.You’ll be my wife, dearest, and I’ll serve
                                you forever.Will you be my husband, then?Yes, with a heart more eager to bear a husband’s
                                responsibilities than a slave ever wanted freedom. Take my hand,
                                darling.Here’s my hand, and my heart. And now goodbye.
                                I’ll see you again in half an hour.
