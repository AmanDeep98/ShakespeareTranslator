If by your art, my dearest father, you havePut the wild waters in this roar, allay them.The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,But that the sea, mounting to th' welkin’s
                                cheek,Dashes the fire out. Oh, I have sufferedWith those that I saw suffer. A brave vesselWho had, no doubt, some noble creature in herDashed all to pieces. Oh, the cry did knockAgainst my very heart! Poor souls, they perished.Had I been any god of power, I wouldHave sunk the sea within the earth or ereIt should the good ship so have swallowed andThe fraughting souls within her.     Be
                                collected.No more amazement. Tell your piteous heartThere’s no harm done.    Oh, woe the
                            day!      No
                                harm.I have done nothing but in care of thee,Of thee, my dear one—thee my daughter, whoArt ignorant of what thou art, naught knowingOf whence I am, nor that I am more betterThan Prospero, master of a full poor cellAnd thy no greater father.    More to knowDid never meddle with my thoughts.#LBSFORGOLDDear father, if you caused this terrible storm with your magic
                                powers, please put an end to it. The sky’s so dark it
                                looks like it would rain down boiling hot tar if the sea
                                weren’t swelling up to the sky to put its fire out. Oh, I
                                suffered along with all the men I watched suffer! A fine ship, with
                                some good people in it, I’m sure, smashed to pieces.
                                Their dying shouts broke my heart! The poor people died. If
                                I’d been a god I would’ve let the sea sink
                                inside the earth before it had a chance to swallow up that ship and
                                all the people it was carrying.Calm down. There’s nothing to get upset about. No harm
                                was done.Oh, what a horrible day!There was no harm, I’m telling you. Everything
                                I’ve done has been for you, my dear daughter. You
                                don’t know what you are, since you don’t know
                                who I am or where I come from, or that I’m better than
                                merely Prospero, your humble father who lives in a poor little
                                shack.It never occurred to me to imagine there was anything more to
                                know.
