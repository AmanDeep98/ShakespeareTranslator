If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here’s
                                a
goodly sight.
O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!How fine my master is! I am afraidHe will chastise me.#LBSFORGOLDThis is a stranger business than men have ever set foot in before,
                                and it’s not natural either. We need some oracle to tell
                                us what’s going on.Sir, my king, don’t waste your time mulling over how
                                strange this business is. When the time is right, and
                                it’ll be soon, I promise I alone will explain everything
                                that’s happened. Until then, be cheerful and keep an open
                                mind. (speaking so that only ARIEL
                                can hear) Come here, spirit; set
                                Caliban and his fellow slaves free. Break the spell that enslaves
                                them to me.How is my lord? There are a few men still missing from the ship, a
                                few odd guys you’ve forgotten about.Look out for the other guy, and don’t put yourself
                                first, since everything happens randomly. Courage! Courage, you fine
                                old monster.If I can believe my eyes, this is a fine sight to see.Oh Setebos, these are handsome spirits! How wonderful my master
                                is! I’m afraid he’ll punish me.
