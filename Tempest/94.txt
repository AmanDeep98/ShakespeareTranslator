All the infections that the sun sucks upFrom bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make himBy inchmeal a disease! His spirits hear meAnd yet I needs must curse. But they’ll nor pinch,Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i' th'
                                mire,Nor lead me like a firebrand in the darkOut of my way, unless he bid 'em. ButFor every trifle are they set upon me,Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me,And after bite me, then like hedgehogs whichLie tumbling in my barefoot way and mountTheir pricks at my footfall. Sometime am IAll wound with adders who with cloven tonguesDo hiss me into madness.    Lo, now, lo!Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment meFor bringing wood in slowly. I’ll fall flat.Perchance he will not mind me.

Here’s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather
                                at all.And another storm brewing, I hear it sing i'
                                th' wind. Yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks
                                like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If it should thunder
                                as it did before, I know not where to hide my head. Yond same cloud
                                cannot choose but fall by pailfuls.

#LBSFORGOLDI hope all the diseases that breed in swamps and marshes infect
                                Prospero, inch by inch, until he’s nothing but a walking
                                disease! His spirits are listening to me, but I can’t
                                help cursing him anyway. They won’t pinch me, frighten
                                me, push me in the mud, or mislead me unless he tells them to. But
                                he sends them to punish me for every little thing. Sometimes his
                                spirits take the form of apes, grimacing and chattering at me and
                                then biting me; sometimes they come like porcupines, my feet as I
                                walk. Sometimes snakes wrap around me, hissing at me with their
                                forked tongues till I go crazy.Hey, look over there! Here comes one of his spirits to torture me
                                for taking so long to bring the wood back. I’ll lie down
                                and hide. Maybe he won’t see me.
                                (he lies down and covers himself with his cloak)
There are no bushes or shrubs to protect me from the weather here.
                                And there’s another storm brewing—I can hear
                                it in the way the wind whistles. That huge black cloud over there
                                looks like a filthy liquor jug that’s about to pour out
                                its contents. It won’t be able to help pouring rain down
                                by the bucket-full. (he sees
