No, monster, not I.Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises,Sounds, and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not.Sometimes a thousand twangling instrumentsWill hum about mine ears, and sometime voicesThat, if I then had waked after long sleep,Will make me sleep again. And then, in dreaming,The clouds methought would open and show richesReady to drop upon me, that when I wakedI cried to dream again.This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have
my music
                                for nothing.
When Prospero is destroyed.That shall be by and by. I remember the story.The sound is going away. Let’s follow it, and after do
                                our
work.
Lead, monster; we’ll follow. I would I could see this
taborer. He lays it on.
Wilt come? I’ll follow, Stephano.#LBSFORGOLDNo, monster, not me.Don’t be scared. This island is full of noises, strange
                                sounds and sweet melodies that make you feel good and
                                don’t hurt anyone. Sometimes I hear a thousand twanging
                                instruments hum at my ears, and sometimes voices that send me back
                                to sleep even if I had just woken up—and then I dreamed
                                of clouds opening up and dropping such riches on me that when I woke
                                up, I cried because I wanted to dream again.This’ll be a wonderful kingdom to live in, where they
                                play music for free.As soon as you kill Prospero.That’ll happen soon enough. I remember the plan.The sound is going away. But let’s follow it, and then
                                do our dirty work afterward.Lead us, monster; we’ll follow. I wish I could see this
                                invisible drummer. He really plays well.I’m right behind you, Stephano. Are you coming
                            monster?
