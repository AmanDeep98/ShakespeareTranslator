For this, be sure, tonight thou shalt have cramps,Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up. UrchinsShall, forth at vast of night that they may work,All exercise on thee. Thou shalt be pinchedAs thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stingingThan bees that made 'em.    I must eat my
                                dinner.This island’s mine, by Sycorax my mother,Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,Thou strok’st me and made much of me, wouldst give meWater with berries in ’t, and teach me howTo name the bigger light, and how the less,That burn by day and night. And then I loved theeAnd showed thee all the qualities o' th'
                                isle,The fresh springs, brine pits, barren place and fertile.Cursed be I that did so! All the charmsOf Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!For I am all the subjects that you have,Which first was mine own king. And here you sty meIn this hard rock, whiles you do keep from meThe rest o' th' island.    Thou most lying
                                slave,Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged theeIn mine own cell till thou didst seek to violateThe honor of my child.Oh ho, oh ho! Would ’t had been done!Thou didst prevent me. I had peopled elseThis isle with Calibans.#LBSFORGOLDI’ll give you cramps for saying
                                that—horrible pains in your sides that will keep you from
                                breathing. I’ll send goblins out at night to work their
                                nasty deeds on you. You’ll be pricked all over, and
                                it’ll sting like bees.I have to eat my dinner now. This island belongs to me because
                                Sycorax, my mother, left it to me. But you’ve taken it
                                from me. When you first got here, you petted me and took care of me,
                                you would give me water with berries in it, and you taught me the
                                names for the sun and the moon, the big light and the smaller light
                                that burn in daytime and nighttime. I loved you back then. I showed
                                you all the features of the island, the freshwater springs, the
                                saltwater pits, the barren places and the fertile ones. I curse
                                myself for doing that! I wish I could use all the magic spells of
                                Sycorax against you and plague you with toads, beetles, and bats.
                                I’m the only subject you have in your kingdom, and you
                                were my first king, and you pen me up in this cave and
                                don’t let me go anywhere else on the island.You liar, you respond better to the whip than to kindness! I took
                                good care of you—piece of filth that you
                                are—and let you stay in my own hut until you tried to
                                rape my daughter.Oh ho, oh ho! I wish I had! You stopped me. If you
                                hadn’t, I would have filled this island with a race of
                                Calibans.
