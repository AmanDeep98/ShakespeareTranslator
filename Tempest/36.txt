This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with childAnd here was left by th' sailors. Thou, my slave,As thou report’st thyself, wast then her servant.And, for thou wast a spirit too delicateTo act her earthy and abhorred commands,Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,By help of her more potent ministersAnd in her most unmitigable rage,Into a cloven pine, within which riftImprisoned thou didst painfully remainA dozen years; within which space she diedAnd left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groansAs fast as mill wheels strike. Then was this island—Save for the son that she did litter here,A freckled whelp hag-born—not honored withA human shape.   Yes, Caliban, her son.Dull thing, I say so. He, that CalibanWhom now I keep in service. Thou best know’stWhat torment I did find thee in. Thy groansOf ever angry bears. It was a tormentDid make wolves howl and penetrate the breastsTo lay upon the damned, which SycoraxCould not again undo. It was mine art,When I arrived and heard thee, that made gapeThe pine and let thee out.     I
                                thank thee, master.If thou more murmur’st, I will rend an oakAnd peg thee in his knotty entrails tillThou hast howled away twelve winters.#LBSFORGOLDThis sunken-eyed hag was brought here pregnant and left by the
                                sailors. You, my slave, were her servant at the time, as you admit
                                yourself. You were too delicate to carry out her horrible orders,
                                and you refused. In a fit of rage she locked you up in a hollow pine
                                tree, with the help of her powerful assistants, and left you there
                                for twelve years. During that time she died, and you were trapped,
                                moaning and groaning as fast as the blades of a millA mill is a building with machinery for grinding grain into flour. If built next to a river, the machinery would be driven by a paddled wheel propelled by the river.mill wheel strike the water. At that time there were no people
                                here. This island was not honored with a human
                                being—except for the son that Sycorax gave birth to here,
                                a freckled baby born of an old hag.Yes, Caliban, her son.That’s right, you stupid thing. Caliban, who now serves
                                me. You know better than anyone how tortured you were when I found
                                you. Your groans made wolves howl, and even made bears feel sorry
                                for you. Nobody but the damned souls of hell deserves the spell that
                                Sycorax put on you and couldn’t undo. It was my magic
                                that saved you when I arrived on the island and heard you, making
                                the pine tree open and let you out.Thank you, master.If you complain any more, I’ll split an oak tree and
                                lock you up in it till you’ve howled for twelve
                            years.
