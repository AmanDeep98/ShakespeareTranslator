     But
                                one fiend at a time,I’ll fight their legions o'er.    I’ll be
                                thy second.All three of them are desperate. Their great guilt,Like poison given to work a great time after,Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech youThat are of suppler joints, follow them swiftlyAnd hinder them from what this ecstasyMay now provoke them to.    Follow, I pray
                                you.#LBSFORGOLDI’ll fight every one of these devils if I have to, one
                                at a time.I’ll back you up.All three of them are crazy with despair. Their guilt is finally
                                starting to gnaw at them, like a slow-acting poison. Those of you
                                who are young and active, I beg you to follow them and keep them
                                from doing the crazy things their guilt might push them to
                            do.Follow them, please.
