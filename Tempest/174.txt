                                mine shall.Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feelingOf their afflictions, and shall not myself,One of their kind, that relish all as sharplyPassion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?Though with their high wrongs I am struck to th' quick,Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my furyDo I take part. The rarer action isIn virtue than in vengeance. They being penitent,The sole drift of my purpose doth extendNot a frown further. Go release them, Ariel.My charms I’ll break, their senses I’ll
                                restore,And they shall be themselves.     I’ll
                                fetch them, sir.

Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves,And ye that on the sands with printless footDo chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly himWhen he comes back; you demi-puppets thatBy moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastimeIs to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoiceTo hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimmedThe noontide sun, called forth the mutinous winds,And ’twixt the green sea and the azured vaultSet roaring war—to th' dread rattling
                                thunderHave I given fire, and rifted Jove’s stout oak#LBSFORGOLDI will too. You’re made of air, so if even you feel
                                sorry for them, imagine the pity that I’ll feel, being
                                one of their own human race. I suffer pain just as much as they do,
                                so I’ll sympathize far more than you. Though
                                I’m indignant about their evil deeds, I’ll go
                                with my nobler instincts, which tell me to feel some compassion for
                                them. It’s better to act virtuously rather than
                                vengefully. Now that they’re sorry, I don’t
                                want anything more. Go release them, Ariel. I’ll break my
                                spells and bring them back to their senses, and they’ll
                                feel like themselves again.I’ll go get them, sir.
(drawing a large circle on the stage with
                                    his staff)
                                I’ve darkened the noontime sun with the aid of you elves
                                who live in the hills and brooks and groves, and you who chase the
                                sea on the beach without leaving footprints in the sand, and run
                                away when the waves come back; and you who make toadstools while the
                                moon shines; who make mushrooms as a hobby after the evening bell
                                has rung. With your help I’ve called up the angry winds,
                                and set the green sea and blue sky at war with each other.
                                I’ve given lightning to the thunderclouds, and burned up
                                Jupiter’s beloved oak.
