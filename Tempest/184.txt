    I rather thinkYou have not sought her help, of whose soft graceFor the like loss I have her sovereign aid,And rest myself content.    You the like
                            loss?As great to me as late. And supportableTo make the dear loss have I means much weakerThan you may call to comfort you, for IHave lost my daughter.    A daughter?O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,The king and queen there! That they were, I wishMyself were mudded in that oozy bedWhere my son lies.—When did you lose your
                            daughter?In this last tempest. I perceive these lordsAt this encounter do so much admireThat they devour their reason and scarce thinkTheir eyes do offices of truth, their wordsAre natural breath.—But howsoev'r you haveBeen justled from your senses, know for certainThat I am Prospero and that very dukeWhich was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangelyUpon this shore where you were wracked, was landed,To be the lord on ’t.#LBSFORGOLDI don’t think you’ve tried to endure it.
                                Being patient has helped me a lot, for I have suffered a loss
                                similar to yours.You suffered a loss like mine?Yes, just as great and just as recent. And I have much less to
                                comfort me than you do, since I’ve lost my
                            daughter.A daughter? Oh God, I wish the two of them were alive and living
                                in Naples, as king and queen! I’d give up my life and
                                take my son’s place in the mud on the ocean floor if I
                                could see them alive in Naples.—When did you lose your
                                daughter?In this recent storm. These lords seem so astonished that
                                they’ve lost their use of reason and can hardly believe
                                what they see with their own eyes.—But whatever the
                                reason for your losing your senses, you can know for sure that
                                I’m Prospero, that same duke who was kicked out of Milan
                                and landed on this same island where you landed, and became the lord
                                of it. No more of this story now, for it takes days to tell, not
                                just a chat over breakfast or during this first meeting of
                            ours.
