    Dost thou forgetFrom what a torment I did free thee?No.Thou dost, and think’st it much to tread the oozeOf the salt deep,To run upon the sharp wind of the north,To do me business in the veins o' th' earthWhen it is baked with frost.     I do
                                not, sir.Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgotThe foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envyWas grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her?No, sir.Thou hast. Where was she born? Speak. Tell me.Sir, in Argier.   Oh, was she so? I mustOnce in a month recount what thou hast been,Which thou forget’st. This damned witch Sycorax,For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terribleTo enter human hearing, from Argier,Thou know’st, was banished. For one thing she didThey would not take her life. Is not this true?Ay, sir.#LBSFORGOLDHave you forgotten the torture I freed you from?No.You have forgotten, and you think it’s a burden when I
                                ask you to walk through the ocean, or run on the north wind, or do
                                business for me underground when the earth’s frozen
                                solid.No, I don’t, sir.You lie, you nasty, ungrateful thing! Have you forgotten the
                                horrid witch Sycorax, stooped over with old age and ill will? Have
                                you forgotten her?No, sir.You have. Where was she born? Speak. Tell me.In Algiers, sir.Oh, was she now? I’ll have to tell the story again
                                every month, since you seem to forget it. This damned witch Sycorax
                                was kicked out of Algiers for various witching crimes too terrible
                                for humans to hear about. But for one reason they refused to execute
                                her. Isn’t that true?Yes, sir.
