    I have inly wept,Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods,And on this couple drop a blessèd crown,For it is you that have chalked forth the wayWhich brought us hither.    I say amen,
                                Gonzalo.Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issueShould become kings of Naples? O, rejoiceBeyond a common joy, and set it downWith gold on lasting pillars. In one voyageDid Claribel her husband find at Tunis;And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wifeWhere he himself was lost; Prospero, his dukedomIn a poor isle; and all of us, ourselvesWhen no man was his own.

                                blasphemy,That swear’st grace o'erboard, not an oath
                                on shore?Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?#LBSFORGOLDI’ve been crying to myself just now, or I
                                would’ve said the same thing. Dear gods, bless this
                                couple, since you’re the ones who have shown us the path
                                that led us here.Amen to that, Gonzalo.Was the Duke of Milan kicked out of Milan so his children could
                                become kings of Naples? Oh, this is cause for an extraordinary joy
                                that should be engraved in gold on pillars to last forever. On one
                                and the same trip Claribel found a husband in Tunis, and Ferdinand,
                                her brother, found a wife where he was shipwrecked; Prospero found
                                his dukedom on a poor island; and all of us found ourselves when we
                                lost control of ourselves.

                                defiled our ship with your foul language, don’t you have
                                any gutter talk for us on shore? What’s going on?
