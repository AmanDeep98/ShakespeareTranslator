   Of her societyBe not afraid. I met her deityCutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her sonDove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have doneSome wanton charm upon this man and maid,Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paidTill Hymen’s torch be lighted—but in vain.Mars’s hot minion is returned again.Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrowsAnd be a boy right out.    Highest queen of
                                state,Great Juno, comes. I know her by her gait.How does my bounteous sister? Go with meTo bless this twain that they may prosperous be,And honored in their issue.

                                with her son on her way to her home on Paphos, in a carriage pulled
                                by doves. They were planning to pull a mischievous trick on
                                Ferdinand and Miranda, who have sworn not to sleep together till
                                their wedding day. But their trick failed. Venus went home again,
                                and her little son broke all his arrows, swearing he’ll
                                never shoot them again, but play with birds like other little
                            boys.Great Queen Juno is coming. I know her by her walk.How is my generous sister? Come help me bless this couple, so they
                                will be prosperous and have many children.
