The best news is that we have safely foundOur king and company. The next, our ship—Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split—Is tight and yare and bravely rigged as whenWe first put out to sea.

                                PROSPERO) Sir, all this
                                serviceHave I done since I went.
(aside to
                                ARIEL) My tricksy
                            spirit!These are not natural events. They strengthenFrom strange to stranger.—
(to
                                BOATSWAIN) Say, how came
                                you hither?If I did think, sir, I were well awake,I’d strive to tell you. We were dead of sleepAnd—how, we know not—all clapped under
                                hatches,Where but even now with strange and several noisesOf roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,We were awaked, straightway at liberty,Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheldOur royal, good, and gallant ship, our MasterCapering to eye her. On a trice, so please you,Even in a dream were we divided from themAnd were brought moping hither.
(aside to
                                PROSPERO)  Was
                                ’t well done?
(aside to
                                ARIEL) Bravely, my diligence. Thou
                                shalt be free.#LBSFORGOLDThe best news of all is that we’ve located our king and
                                our men. The next bit of good news is that our ship—which
                                we gave up for ruined only three hours ago—is as
                                well-outfitted and seaworthy as it was when we first set
                            sail.
(speaking so that only PROSPERO
                                can hear) Sir, I’ve done
                                all this work for you since I left you last.
(speaking so that only ARIEL
                                can hear) My clever spirit!These are unnatural events. They get stranger all the
                                time.—(to
                                BOATSWAIN) Tell me, how did you get
                                here?If I were sure I was wide awake, I’d try to tell you.
                                We were fast asleep and somehow—we don’t know
                                how—we were stowed below deck, where we heard lots of
                                roaring, shrieking, howling, and jingling chains. The sounds were so
                                horrible that we woke up liberated, and saw our wonderful ship safe
                                and sound. The master was dancing with joy to see it. In an instant
                                we were separated from them, as if in a dream, and brought here in a
                                daze.
(speaking so that only PROSPERO
                                can hear) Did I do it right?
(speaking so that only ARIEL
                                can hear) You did it perfectly, my
                                little worker. You’ll get your freedom.
