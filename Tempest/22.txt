                                the condition.The King of Naples, being an enemyTo me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit,Which was that he, in lieu o' th' premisesOf homage and I know not how much tribute,Should presently extirpate me and mineOut of the dukedom, and confer fair MilanWith all the honors on my brother. Whereon,A treacherous army levied, one midnightFated to th' purpose did Antonio openThe gates of Milan, and, i' th' dead of
                                darkness,The ministers for th' purpose hurried thenceMe and thy crying self.    Alack, for pity!I, not remembering how I cried out then,Will cry it o'er again. It is a hintThat wrings mine eyes to ’t.    Hear a little

                                women sometimes give birth to bad sons.Now listen to the agreement they made. The king of Naples, my
                                arch-enemy, listens to my brother’s request, which was

                                I’ll cry all over again. This story breaks my
                            heart.Just listen a little more, and I’ll bring you up to
                                date about the present situation, which is the whole reason
