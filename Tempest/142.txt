                                harpy hast thouPerformed, my Ariel. A grace it had, devouring.Of my instruction hast thou nothing batedIn what thou hadst to say.—So with good lifeAnd observation strange, my meaner ministersTheir several kinds have done. My high charms workAnd these mine enemies are all knit upIn their distractions. They now are in my power,And in these fits I leave them while I visitYoung Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drowned,And his and mine loved darling.

                                monstrous, monstrous.Methought the billows spoke and told me of it,The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,That deep and dreadful organ pipe, pronouncedThe name of Prosper. It did bass my trespass.Therefore my son i' th' ooze is bedded, andI’ll seek him deeper than e'er plummet

(to himself) You’ve
                                played the role of harpy very well, my Ariel. You were fierce but
                                graceful. You said everything I told you to say.—In the
                                same lifelike way, and with the same attention to detail, my
                                lower-ranking servants have done what they were supposed to do. My
                                magic powers are all in full swing, and my enemies are confused and
                                running around in circles. They’re under my control, and
                                I’m keeping them in their crazy fits while I go visit
                                Ferdinand, whom they think has drowned, and the young woman he and I
                                both love.
(to
                                ALONSO) For the love of God, sir, why
                                are you standing here staring into space like this?Oh, it’s horrible, horrible. I thought the clouds were
                                talking to me, the winds were singing to me, and the thunder, like
                                an awful organ pipe, roared Prospero’s name. It sang
                                about my crimes. Because of my crimes my son is dead on the ocean
                                floor. I’ll go join him there, going down deeper than any
                                anchor ever sank, and lie with him dead in the mud.
