Now my charms are all o'erthrown,And what strength I have’s mine own,Which is most faint. Now, ’tis true,I must be here confined by you,Or sent to Naples. Let me not,Since I have my dukedom gotAnd pardoned the deceiver, dwellIn this bare island by your spell,But release me from my bandsWith the help of your good hands.Gentle breath of yours my sailsMust fill, or else my project fails,Which was to please. Now I wantSpirits to enforce, art to enchant,And my ending is despair,Unless I be relieved by prayer,Which pierces so that it assaultsMercy itself and frees all faults.As you from crimes would pardoned be,Let your indulgence set me free.#LBSFORGOLDNow my spells are all broken,And the only power I have is my own,Which is very weak. Now you allHave got the power to keep me prisoner here,Or send me off to Naples. Please don’tKeep me here on this desert islandWith your magic spells. Release meSo I can return to my dukedomWith your help. The gentle windYou blow with your applauseWill fill my ship’s sails. Without applause,My plan to please you has failed.Now I have no spirits to enslave,No magic to cast spells,And I’ll end up in despairUnless I’m relieved by prayer,Which wins over God himselfAnd absolves all sins.Just as you’d like to have your sins forgiven,Indulge me, forgive me, and set me free.
