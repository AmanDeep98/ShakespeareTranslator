Th' harmony of their tongues hath into bondageBrought my too diligent ear. For several virtuesHave I liked several women. Never anyWith so full soul but some defect in herDid quarrel with the noblest grace she owedAnd put it to the foil. But you, O you,So perfect and so peerless, are createdOf every creature’s best.     I do
                                not knowOne of my sex, no woman’s face remember—Save, from my glass, mine own. Nor have I seenMore that I may call men than you, good friend,And my dear father. How features are abroadI am skill-less of, but, by my modesty,The jewel in my dower, I would not wishAny companion in the world but you,Nor can imagination form a shapeBesides yourself to like of. But I prattleSomething too wildly, and my father’s preceptsI therein do forget.    I am in my
                                conditionA prince, Miranda—I do think, a king;I would, not so!—and would no more endureThis wooden slavery than to sufferThe flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak.The very instant that I saw you didMy heart fly to your service, there residesTo make me slave to it, and for your sakeAm I this patient log-man.     Do you
                                love me?O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this soundAnd crown what I profess with kind event#LBSFORGOLDseduced by the sweet nothings they said to me. I’ve
                                liked several women for their good qualities, but there was
                                something wrong with each one that blotted her excellent qualities
                                and cancelled them out. But with you it’s different.
                                You’re perfect, without a rival in the world, made up of
                                the best qualities of every creature.I’ve never known any woman or seen a woman’s
                                face—except my own in the mirror. And I’ve
                                never met any men besides you and my father. I have no idea what
                                people look like in other places, but I swear by my modesty, which I
                                value above everything else, that I’d never want any
                                companion in the world but you. I can’t even imagine one.
                                But listen to me chattering like crazy, and father always told me
                                not to.I’m a prince by birth, Miranda—maybe even a
                                king now; though I wish I weren’t—and normally
                                I wouldn’t put up with carrying these logs any more than
                                I’d let flies breed in my mouth. But I’ll tell
                                you something from my soul. The second I saw you, my heart rushed to
                                serve you and be your slave, so here I am now, a patient
                            log-man.Do you love me?Oh heaven, oh earth, witness what I’m about to say, and
                                reward me if I tell the truth! If I’m lying, then
