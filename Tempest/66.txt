No, he doth but mistake the truth totally.But the rarity of it is—which is indeed almost beyond
credit—
As many vouched rarities are.That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in the sea, hold
                                notwithstanding their freshness and glosses, being rather new-dyed
                                than stained with salt water.If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not say he
                            lies?Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on
                                first in Afric, at the marriage of the king’s fair
                                daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our
                                return.Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their
                            queen.Not since widow Dido’s time.Widow! A pox o' that! How came that
                                “widow” in? Widow Dido!#LBSFORGOLDNo, he just gets reality completely wrong.But the really unbelievable thing is—and this is
                                incredible—As most unbelievable things are.That our clothes were drenched with sea water, but they came out
                                looking brand-new.Listen to him. If his clothes could talk, they’d call
                                him a liar.Or stuff what he says into their pockets.Seriously, I think our clothes are as fresh now as they were the
                                day we put them on in Africa, when we attended the marriage of the
                                king’s daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.It was a lovely wedding, and we’re doing really well on
                                our trip home.Tunis has never had such a beautiful queen.Not since the days of widow DidoAccording to Greek legend, Dido was the founder of the city of Carthage, on the coast of Africa Dido. Widow? Why the hell is he calling her “widow
                                Dido”?
