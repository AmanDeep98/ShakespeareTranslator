                            more.What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!Marvelous sweet music!Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?A living drollery. Now I will believeThat there are unicorns, that in ArabiaThere is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenixAt this hour reigning there.     I’ll
                                believe bothAnd what does else want credit, come to me,And I’ll be sworn ’tis true. Travelers

                                in NaplesI should report this now, would they believe me?If I should say, I saw such islanders—For, certes, these are people of the island—Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet note,Their manners are more gentle-kind than ofOur human generation you shall findMany—nay, almost any.

(speaking so that only ANTONIO
                                can hear) Yes, tonight. No more
                                talking about this now.What’s that music? My friends, listen.What marvelous music!Heaven help us! What were those things?A puppet show in real life. Now I’ll believe that
                                unicorns exist, and that there’s a tree in Arabia where
                                the phoenix lives.Me too. And anything else that’s hard to believe, just
                                ask me and I’ll swear it’s true. Travelers
                                have never told lies, no matter what the fools at home accuse them
                                of.If I told them about this back in Naples, would they believe me?
                                I’d tell them that I saw natives like
                                these—since they must be natives—who are
                                graceful and well-mannered even if they’re monstrous to
                                look at, kinder than most human beings you might find—
                                kinder than almost any human.
(to himself) My good lord,
                                you’re absolutely right, since some of you are worse than
                                devils.
