                                sir King,The wrongèd Duke of Milan, Prospero.For more assurance that a living princeDoes now speak to thee, I embrace thy body.And to thee and thy company I bidA hearty welcome. (embraces

    Whe'er
                                thou beest he or no,Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,As late I have been, I not know. Thy pulseBeats as of flesh and blood. And since I saw thee,Th' affliction of my mind amends, with whichI fear a madness held me. This must crave—An if this be at all—a most strange story.Thy dukedom I resign and do entreatThou pardon me my wrongs. But how should ProsperoBe living and be here?
(to
                                GONZALO)    First,
                                noble friend,Let me embrace thine age, whose honor cannotBe measured or confined.#LBSFORGOLDBoatswain, who will be awake, and bring them here right away,
                                please.I’ll go so fast I’ll burn up the air, and
                                come back in two heartbeats.This place is full of trouble, torments, and amazements. Please
                                come, heavenly powers, and guide us out of this godforsaken
                            country!
(to
                                ALONSO) Your Highness, you see before
                                you the Duke of Milan, Prospero, who’s been wronged.
                                I’ll embrace you now so you will know it’s
                                really me, a living prince, talking to you. I heartily welcome you
                                and your entourage here. (he embraces
                                ALONSO)
Whether you’re really him or whether this is some magic
                                trick like I was recently subjected to, I don’t know.
                                Your heart beats like you were real, and ever since I saw you, I
                                feel my mind becoming sane again, released from its earlier
                                insanity. There must be a strange explanation for this—if
                                it’s true. I surrender your dukedom and beg you to
                                forgive me all my crimes. But how is it possible that
                                Prospero’s alive and well and living on this
                            island?
(to
                                GONZALO) First, my noble old friend,
                                let me embrace you, who are more honorable than I can say.
