                                joking around like usual. You should be serious too when you listen
                                to what I’m saying. You can become a great man if you
                                listen to me.I’m hanging on every word you say.You need to do more than hang around—you have to act.
                                I’ll show you how.You need to. I’m lazy by nature.Oh, if you only knew how close to success you are, even while you
                                make fun of what I’m telling you! The more you joke about
                                it, the more clearly I feel how serious it is! Lazy people end up at
                                the bottom, and you deserve to be at the top.Please, tell me more. There’s something in your
                                expression that tells me you have something serious to say, and
                                you’re having a lot of difficulty saying it.This is what I’m saying.

                                such a bad memory—and who will be forgotten by the world
                                when he’s dead and buried—almost succeeded in
                                convincing the king that his son’s alive, it’s
                                impossible that he survived. It’s as far from the truth
                                as saying this sleeping man is swimming.
