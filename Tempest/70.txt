And the rarest that e'er came there.Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.Oh, widow Dido? Ay, widow Dido.Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it? I
                                mean, in a sort.That “sort” was well fished for.When I wore it at your daughter’s marriage?You cram these words into mine ears againstThe stomach of my sense. Would I had neverMarried my daughter there! For, coming thence,My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,Who is so far from Italy removedI ne'er again shall see her.—O thou mine
                                heirOf Naples and of Milan, what strange fishHath made his meal on thee?      Sir,
                                he may live.I saw him beat the surges under him,And ride upon their backs. He trod the water,Whose enmity he flung aside, and breastedThe surge most swoll'n that met him. His bold head'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oaredHimself with his good arms in lusty strokeTo th' shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis
                                bowed,As stooping to relieve him. I not doubtHe came alive to land.#LBSFORGOLDThe most beautiful queen they ever had.I beg your pardon, except for the widow Dido.Oh, except for the widow Dido? That’s right, except for
                                the widow Dido.Isn’t my vest just as clean and fresh as the day I put
                                it on? In a way, I mean.“In a way” is the right way to go.I mean when I wore it at your daughter’s
                            wedding.You keep cramming words into my ears that I don’t want
                                to hear. I wish that wedding had never happened, since I lost my son
                                because of it, and I lost my daughter too in a way, since
                                she’s moved so far from Milan that I’ll never
                                see her again.—Oh, dear son of mine and heir of Naples
                                and Milan, what strange fish has made a meal of you?Sir, he may still be alive. I saw him swimming strongly, almost as
                                if he was riding the waves. He treaded water and kept his head well
                                above the wild waters coming at him, swimming with his strong arms
                                toward the shore, which almost seemed eager to welcome him. I have
                                no doubt he got ashore alive.
