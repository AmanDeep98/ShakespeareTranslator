A dollar.Dolor comes to him, indeed. You have spoken truer than you
                                purposed.You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
(to
                                ALONSO) Therefore, my
                                lord—
(to
                                SEBASTIAN) Fie, what a spendthrift is
                                he of his tongue!
(to
                                GONZALO) I prithee, spare.Well, I have done. But yet—
(to
                                ANTONIO) He will be talking.Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first begins to
                            crow?The old cock.The cockerel.Done. The wager?A laughter.A match!Though this island seem to be desert—
(to
                                SEBASTIAN) Ha, ha, ha!#LBSFORGOLDWhat a pain.Pain, yes indeed. We would find ourselves in pain. You thought you
                                were being funny, but you said the truth.You’re taking it more seriously than I meant it.
(to
                                ALONSO) Therefore,
                            sir—
(to
                                SEBASTIAN) God, doesn’t he
                                ever shut up?
(to
                                GONZALO) Please, no more.Well, I’m nearly finished. But just one last
                                thing—
(to
                                ANTONIO) He insists on
                            talking.Hey, let’s bet. Which one will start yammering first,
                                Gonzalo or Adrian?The old guy.I pick the younger one.You’re on. What’s the prize?A good laugh.It’s a deal!Though this island may appear desolate—
(to
                                SEBASTIAN) Ha, ha, ha!
