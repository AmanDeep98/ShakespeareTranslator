                                punished you,Your compensation makes amends, for IHave given you here a third of mine own life—Or that for which I live—who once againI tender to thy hand. All thy vexationsWere but my trials of thy love and thouHast strangely stood the test. Here, afore heaven,I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,Do not smile at me that I boast of her,For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praiseAnd make it halt behind her.     I do believe itAgainst an oracle.Then as my gift and thine own acquisitionWorthily purchased, take my daughter. ButIf thou dost break her virgin knot beforeAll sanctimonious ceremonies mayWith full and holy rite be ministered,No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fallTo make this contract grow, but barren hate,Sour-eyed disdain, and discord shall bestrewThe union of your bed with weeds so loathlyThat you shall hate it both. Therefore take heed,As Hymen’s lamps shall light you.#LBSFORGOLD

                                FERDINAND) If I’ve
                                punished you too harshly, I’m ready to make it up to you
                                now, since I’ve given you a third of my
                                life—everything I live for—my daughter
                                Miranda. I put her in your hands. All the trouble I put you through
                                was to test your love for her, and you’ve passed the test
                                remarkably well. As heaven is my witness, I give you this valuable
                                gift. Oh Ferdinand, don’t smile at me for bragging about
                                Miranda, for you’ll see soon enough that she outshines
                                any praise of her.I’d believe it even if oraclesAn oracle is someone who delivers messages from the gods.oracles told me differently.Then take my daughter, both as my gift to you and as something you
                                have earned. But if you have sex with her before the marriage
                                ceremony takes place, the heavens will not bless your relationship,
                                but will overwhelm you with hate, contempt, and discord, and will
                                poison your marriage bed so that you both grow to loathe it. So be
                                careful, and make sure you respect the holy institution of
                            marriage.
