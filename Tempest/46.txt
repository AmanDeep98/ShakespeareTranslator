 Come unto these yellow
                                sands, And then take hands. Curtsied when you have, and
                                    kissed
 The wild waves whist. Foot it featly here and
                                there, And, sweet sprites,
                                bear
 The burden. Hark,
                            hark!

(dispersedly, within)
                            Bow-wow.The watchdogs bark.
(within) Bow-wow.Hark, hark! I hearThe strain of strutting chanticleerCry “Cock-a-diddle-dow.”Where should this music be? I' th' air or
                                th' earth?It sounds no more, and sure, it waits uponSome god o' th' island. Sitting on a bank,Weeping again the king my father’s wrack,This music crept by me upon the waters,Allaying both their fury and my passionWith its sweet air. Thence I have followed it,Or it hath drawn me rather. But ’tis gone.No, it begins again.#LBSFORGOLD(singing) Come onto these yellow
                                sands, And we’ll join
                                hands, When you’ve curtsied
                                    and kissed
 The waves into silence. Prance lightly here and
                                there, And the sweet spirits
                                bear
 The burden. Listen,
                                listen!

(refrain of the song is heard offstage,
                                    from different places, not in unison)
                                Bow-wow.The watchdogs bark.
(offstage) Bow-wow.Listen, listen! I hearThe tune of the strutting roosterWho cries cock-a-doodle-doo.Where’s that music coming from? From the earth, or the
                                air? It’s stopped now—it must be played for
                                some local god of the island. As I sat on the shore crying over my
                                father’s shipwreck, I heard the music creep over the wild
                                waves, calming their fury and soothing my own grief with its sweet
                                melodies. I followed it here, or I should say it dragged me here.
                                But now it’s stopped. No, there it is again.
