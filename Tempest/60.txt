Beseech you, sir, be merry. You have cause,So have we all, of joy, for our escapeIs much beyond our loss. Our hint of woeIs common. Every day some sailor’s wife,The masters of some merchant, and the merchantHave just our theme of woe. But for the miracle—I mean our preservation—few in millionsCan speak like us. Then wisely, good sir, weighOur sorrow with our comfort.     Prithee,
                                peace.

                                ANTONIO) He receives comfort like
                                cold porridge.
(to
                                SEBASTIAN) The visitor will not give
                                him o'er so.Look he’s winding up the watch of his wit. By and by it
                                will strike.
(to
                                ALONSO) Sir—
(to
                                ANTONIO) One. Tell.When every grief is entertained that’s offered,Comes to th' entertainer—#LBSFORGOLD
(to
                                ALONSO) Please cheer up, sir. Like
                                all of us, you have a good reason to be happy. The fact that
                                we’re alive outweighs our losses. Many people every day
                                feel the sadness we feel now. Every day some sailor’s
                                wife, a ship’s crew, the merchant who hired the ship all
                                experience the same loss we’ve undergone. But the
                                miracle—the fact that we were saved—only
                                happens to a few people out of millions. So remember that, and take
                                comfort in it, to counterbalance our sadness.Please say no more.

                                ANTONIO) Alonso enjoys these
                                comforting words about as much as cold oatmeal.
(to
                                SEBASTIAN) But the goodwill
                                ambassador won’t give up that easily.
(to
                                ANTONIO) Look. He’s like a
                                clock winding up to strike the hour.
(to
                                ALONSO) Sir—
(to
                                ANTONIO) There he goes! Now we can
                                tell what time it is.If we let every sad thing that happens to us get us down, then we
                                would find ourselves—
