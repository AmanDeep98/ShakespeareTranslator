(to
                                ALONSO) By 'r lakin, I can
                                go no further, sir.My old bones ache. Here’s a maze trod indeedThrough forthrights and meanders. By your patience,I needs must rest me.    Old lord, I cannot
                                blame thee,Who am myself attached with wearinessTo th' dulling of my spirits. Sit down and rest.Even here I will put off my hope and keep itNo longer for my flatterer. He is drownedWhom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocksOur frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.
(aside to
                                SEBASTIAN) I am right glad that
                                he’s so out of hope.Do not for one repulse forego the purposeThat you resolved t' effect.
(aside to
                                ANTONIO)  The
                                next advantageWill we take throughly.
(aside to
                                SEBASTIAN) Let it be
                                tonight,For now they are oppressed with travel. TheyWill not, nor cannot, use such vigilanceAs when they are fresh.#LBSFORGOLDI swear, I can’t go any further, sir. My old bones are
                                tired. We’re wandering in a maze. If you don’t
                                mind, I need to rest a bit.I can’t blame you, old lord. I’m so tired
                                myself that it’s bringing me down. Sit down and rest.
                                I’m losing hope. The one we’re looking for is
                                dead. We’re searching on land, but he’s lost
                                in the sea. We have to give up and let him go.
(speaking so that only SEBASTIAN
                                can hear) I’m glad
                                he’s so depressed. Don’t back out of our plan
                                just because it didn’t work the first time.
(speaking so that only ANTONIO
                                can hear) The next chance we get,
                                we’ll do the deed.
(speaking so that only SEBASTIAN
                                can hear) Let’s do it
                                tonight. The men are so tired from traveling that they
                                can’t be as careful as they are when they’re
                                fresh.
