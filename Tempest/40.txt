    But as
                                ’tis,We cannot miss him. He does make our fire,Fetch in our wood, and serves in officesThat profit us.—What, ho! Slave! Caliban!Thou earth, thou! Speak.
(within)    There’s
                                wood enough within.Come forth, I say! There’s other business for thee.Come, thou tortoise! When?Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,Hark in thine ear. (whispers to
                                ARIEL)
    My lord it shall
                                be done.
(to
                                CALIBAN) Thou poisonous slave, got by
                                the devil himselfUpon thy wicked dam, come forth!As wicked dew as e'er my mother brushedWith raven’s feather from unwholesome fenDrop on you both! A southwest blow on yeAnd blister you all o'er!#LBSFORGOLDBut even so, we can’t do without him. He builds our
                                fires, gets our firewood, and does all kinds of useful things for
                                us.—Hey! Caliban! Pile of dirt! Say something.
(offstage) You’ve got
                                enough firewood already.Come out, I order you. There’s other work for you to
                                do. Come on, you turtle!What a fine sight! My dear clever Ariel, listen carefully.
                                (he whispers to
                                ARIEL)
My lord, I’ll do it right away.
(to
                                CALIBAN) You horrible slave, with a
                                wicked hag for a mother and the devil himself for a father, come
                                out!I hope you both get drenched with a dew as evil as what my mother
                                used to collect with a crow’s feather from the poison
                                swamps. May a hot southwest wind blow on you and cover you with
                                blisters all over.
