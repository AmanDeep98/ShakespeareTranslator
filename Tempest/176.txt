With his own bolt;    the strong-based
                                promontoryHave I made shake, and by the spurs plucked upThe pine and cedar; graves at my commandHave waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forthBy my so potent art. But this rough magicI here abjure, and when I have requiredSome heavenly music, which even now I do,To work mine end upon their senses thatThis airy charm is for, I’ll break my staff,Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,And deeper than did ever plummet soundI’ll drown my book.A solemn air and the best comforterTo an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,Now useless, boiled within thy skull.—There stand,For you are spell-stopped.—
(to
                                GONZALO) Holy Gonzalo, honorable man,Mine eyes, ev'n sociable to the show of thine,Fall fellowly drops.
(aside)    The
                                charm dissolves apace,And as the morning steals upon the night,Melting the darkness, so their rising sensesBegin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantleTheir clearer reason.—

                                GONZALO)     O
                                good Gonzalo,My true preserver and a loyal sir#LBSFORGOLDWith his own lightning bolts; I’ve shaken up the sturdy
                                cliffs and uprooted pines and cedars; I’ve opened up
                                graves and awakened the corpses sleeping in them, letting them out
                                with my powerful magic. But I surrender all this magic now, when
                                I’ve summoned some heavenly music to cast a spell, as
                                I’m doing now, I’ll break my staff and bury it
                                far underground, and throw my book of magic spells deeper into the
                                sea than any anchor ever sank.Let this solemn melody comfort your fevered minds, which are now
                                useless, seething inside your skulls.—All of you stand
                                there in my spell.—(to
                                GONZALO) Good Gonzalo, you honorable
                                man, my eyes weep for you, since I feel what you must feel now.
                                (to himself) The spell is breaking
                                gradually, and just as dawn creeps in and melts away the darkness,
                                they will slowly return to their
                                senses.—(to
                                GONZALO) Oh, my dear Gonzalo,
                                you’re my savior and loyal to your lord, I’ll
                                reward you fully, not just with praise but with actions
                                too.—
