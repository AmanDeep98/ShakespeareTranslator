    I pray thee, mark
                                me.I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicatedTo closeness and the bettering of my mindWith that which, but by being so retired,O'erprized all popular rate, in my false brotherAwaked an evil nature. And my trust,Like a good parent, did beget of himA falsehood in its contrary as greatAs my trust was, which had indeed no limit,A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,Not only with what my revenue yieldedBut what my power might else exact, like oneWho having into truth, by telling of it,Made such a sinner of his memoryTo credit his own lie—he did believeHe was indeed the duke, out o' th'
                                substitutionAnd executing th' outward face of royalty,With all prerogative. Hence his ambition growing—Dost thou hear?    Your tale, sir,
                                would cure deafness.To have no screen between this part he playedAnd him he played it for, he needs will beAbsolute Milan. Me, poor man, my libraryWas dukedom large enough. Of temporal royaltiesHe thinks me now incapable, confederates—So dry he was for sway—wi' th'
                                King of NaplesTo give him annual tribute, do him homage,Subject his coronet to his crown and bendThe dukedom yet unbowed—alas, poor Milan!—To most ignoble stooping.    Oh, the
                            heavens!#LBSFORGOLDPlease listen to me carefully. As I neglected practical matters,
                                being totally dedicated to solitude and to improving my mind with
                                subjects more valuable than most people imagine, I was so shut away
                                from the world that I unwittingly stirred up evil wishes in my
                                disloyal brother. My deep trust in him made him deeply
                                untrustworthy, arousing in him a treachery as big as my trust
                                was—my trust which had no limit, an infinite confidence.
                                With Antonio possessing such powers and wealth, coming not only from
                                my income but also from his ability to take whatever my authority
                                allowed him to take, Antonio started to believe that he was the
                                duke, like some liar who begins to believe in his own lie. He put on
                                the face of royalty, with all the rights that go along with it. With
                                his ambition growing like this—do you hear what
                                I’m saying?What you’re saying could cure deafness, father. Of
                                course I hear it.To make his political performance absolutely perfect, he simply
                                had to become the Duke of Milan himself. My library was a large
                                enough dukedom for me. So, now Antonio judges me incapable of
                                carrying out my duties. He’s so power-hungry that he
                                allies himself with the King of Naples, agreeing to pay him a
                                regular annual sum, swear subservience to him, and put the dukedom
                                of Milan—never subservient to anyone
                                before!—under the humiliating control of Naples.Good heavens!
