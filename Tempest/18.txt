    Oh, my heart
                                bleedsTo think o' th' teen that I have turned you
                                to,Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.My brother and thy uncle, called Antonio—I pray thee, mark me (that a brother shouldBe so perfidious!)—he whom next thyselfOf all the world I loved and to him putThe manage of my state, as at that timeThrough all the signories it was the first,And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputedIn dignity, and for the liberal artsWithout a parallel. Those being all my study,The government I cast upon my brotherAnd to my state grew stranger, being transportedAnd rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle—Dost thou attend me?    Sir, most
                                heedfully.Being once perfected how to grant suits,How to deny them, who t' advance and whoTo trash for overtopping, new createdThe creatures that were mine, I say—or changed
                                'em,Or else new formed 'em—having both the keyOf officer and office, set all hearts i' th'
                                stateTo what tune pleased his ear, that now he wasThe ivy which had hid my princely trunk,And sucked my verdure out on ’t. Thou
                                attend’st not.O, good sir, I do.#LBSFORGOLDOh, it breaks my heart to think how painful it must be for you to
                                recall all this, things that I can’t remember. But please
                                tell me more.My brother, your uncle Antonio—just listen to this (I
                                still can’t believe a brother could be so
                                disloyal!)—My brother whom—aside from
                                you—I loved more than anyone else in the world, I trusted
                                to run my state, which at that time was the strongest in the land,
                                and Prospero the number one duke, famous for my dignity and my
                                education. Since I was so drawn to studying things like logic,
                                grammar, geometry, and astronomy, I let my control of the government
                                slide a bit, being too wrapped up in my occult books. Your disloyal
                                uncle—are you paying attention?I’m hanging on every word.Once Antonio got the knack of granting certain requests, denying
                                others, promoting some officials and keeping down those who were
                                getting too ambitious, he won over the people who used to be mine,
                                or changed them—remade them, you might say. Since he had
                                control over the whole government and everyone in it, he soon made
                                everyone sing his own song—whichever song he happened to
                                like. He became like the ivy that sticks to the side of the tree,
                                and sucked my vitality out of me.—You’re not
                                paying attention.Oh, yes I am, father.
