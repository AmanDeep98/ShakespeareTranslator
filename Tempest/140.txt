You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,That hath to instrument this lower worldAnd what is in ’t, the never-surfeited seaHath caused to belch up you—and on this islandWhere man doth not inhabit, you ’mongst menBeing most unfit to live. I have made you mad,And even with suchlike valor men hang and drownTheir proper selves.
                                (some of the courtiers
                                    draw their swords)
    You fools, I and
                                my fellowsAre ministers of fate. The elementsOf whom your swords are tempered may as wellWound the loud winds or with bemocked-at stabsKill the still-closing waters as diminishOne dowl that’s in my plume. My fellow ministersAre like invulnerable. If you could hurt,Your swords are now too massy for your strengthsAnd will not be uplifted. But remember—For that’s my business to you—that you threeFrom Milan did supplant good Prospero,Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,Him and his innocent child. For which foul deedThe powers—delaying, not forgetting—haveIncensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,Against your peace.—Thee of thy son, Alonso,They have bereft, and do pronounce by meLingering perdition, worse than any deathCan be at once, shall step by step attendYou and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from—Which here, in this most desolate isle, else fallsUpon your heads—is nothing but hearts'

(to ALONSO, ANTONIO,
                                and
                                SEBASTIAN) The three of you are
                                sinners, and Destiny made the sea belch you up onto this
                                island—where no men live, since none of you deserve to
                                live. I’ve driven you crazy, and many mad people are
                                driven to kill themselves in desperation.
                                (some of the courtiers draw their
                                swords)
                                Listen, you fools, my fellow harpiesA harpy is a mythological creature with a woman’s face and breasts and the wings and claws of a bird. Shakespeare apparently intended to have Ariel appear together with two other harpies.harpies and I carry out Fate’s orders. Your swords are
                                useless against us—you’d be more successful
                                swinging them at the empty air, or stabbing at water, than trying to
                                cut off even one of my feathers. My two companions are just as
                                invulnerable as I am. Even if you had the power to hurt us,
                                you’d find your swords far too heavy to lift. But
                                remember—and it’s my job to remind you of
                                this—that in Milan the three of you stole
                                Prospero’s throne and threw him and his innocent child
                                into the sea, which has now taken revenge on you. To punish you for
                                this horrible crime, the higher powers—delaying their
                                punishment, not forgetting about it—have stirred up the
                                seas and all the creatures of earth against
                                you.—They’ve taken your only son from you,
                                Alonso, and they’ve ordered me to destroy you slowly, in
                                a way worse than sudden death could ever be. I’ll stay
                                with you every step of your way. The only way to protect yourselves
                                from the angry higher powers—which are ready to fall upon
                                your head on this empty island—is for you to be sincerely
                                sorry in your hearts for what you’ve done, and to live
                                innocent lives from this time forward.
