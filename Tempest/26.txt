Here cease more questions.#LBSFORGOLDWith God’s help. We had a little food and fresh water
                                that a nobleman from Naples, Gonzalo, had given us out of the
                                kindness of his heart. He had been chosen to carry out the plan of
                                putting us to sea. He also gave us clothes, linen, and other
                                necessities that have been of great help. Knowing how much I loved
                                my books, he gave me some books from my library that I value more
                                than my dukedom.I wish I could see that man someday!Now I’ll stand up.

                                Sit still and listen to the last of our sad sea adventures. We
                                arrived here on this island, where I, acting as your teacher, have
                                given you a better education than most princesses get, princesses
                                who have less careful tutors, who spend their time instead on empty
                                fun.May God thank you for it. But please, father—the
                                question is still nagging at me—why did you conjure up
                                this storm?You should know this: much luck is on my side, and my enemies have
                                happened to wreck their ship on this island. As I see it, my fate
                                hangs on this lucky event, and if I handle it wrong, I’ll
                                suffer for the rest of my life. Now, no more questions.
