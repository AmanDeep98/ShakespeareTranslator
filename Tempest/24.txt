    Well demanded,
                                wench.My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,So dear the love my people bore me, nor setA mark so bloody on the business, butWith colors fairer painted their foul ends.In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,Bore us some leagues to sea, where they preparedA rotten carcass of a butt, not rigged,Nor tackle, sail, nor mast. The very ratsInstinctively had quit it. There they hoist usTo cry to th' sea that roared to us, to sighTo th' winds whose pity, sighing back again,Did us but loving wrong.    Alack, what
                                troubleWas I then to you!    Oh, a cherubimThou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smileInfusèd with a fortitude from heaven,When I have decked the sea with drops full salt,Under my burthen groaned; which raised in meAn undergoing stomach to bear upAgainst what should ensue.How came we ashore?#LBSFORGOLDGood question, my girl. My story does raise that question. The
                                answer, my dear, is that they didn’t dare, because the
                                people of Milan loved me too much. The had to disguise their bloody
                                intentions. So, to make a long story short, they hurried us onto a
                                ship and carried us a number of miles out to sea, where they
                                prepared a rotten carcass of a boat, with no sails or masts or
                                ropes, which even the rats had abandoned. They tossed us in the
                                water to cry to the sea that roared back at us, to sigh into the
                                winds that sighed right back at us in pity.God, what a burden on you I must have been!No, my dear, you were a little angel who kept me going. You smiled
                                with a strength you must have gotten from heaven, while I cried
                                salty tears into the salty sea, and groaned at our situation. Your
                                smile sustained my spirits against whatever would come our
                            way.How did we manage to get ashore?
