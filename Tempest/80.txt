What a strange drowsiness possesses them!It is the quality o' th' climate.     WhyDoth it not then our eyelids sink? I find notMyself disposed to sleep.    Nor I. My spirits
                                are nimble.They fell together all, as by consent.They dropped, as by a thunderstroke. What might,Worthy Sebastian, O, what might—? No more.—And yet methinks I see it in thy face,What thou shouldst be. Th' occasion speaks thee, andMy strong imagination sees a crownDropping upon thy head.    What, art thou
                                waking?Do you not hear me speak?    I do, and surelyIt is a sleepy language, and thou speak’stOut of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?This is a strange repose, to be asleepWith eyes wide open, standing, speaking, moving,And yet so fast asleep.    Noble Sebastian,Thou let’st thy fortune sleep—die,
                                rather—wink’stWhiles thou art waking.    Thou dost snore
                                distinctly.There’s meaning in thy snores.#LBSFORGOLDHow strange that they all got so sleepy!There must be something in the air here.So why aren’t our eyelids heavy? I’m not
                                sleepy at all.Me neither. I’m wide awake. They all fell asleep
                                together, as if they’d planned it. Like they’d
                                all been struck by lightning. What might happen, Sebastian, what
                                might happen if—No, it’s time for me to shut
                                up.— But still, I think I can see in your face what you
                                ought to be. Opportunity’s knocking for you, and in my
                                imagination I see a crown dropping onto your head.Are you dreaming or awake?Don’t you hear me speaking?I do, and it sounds like you’re talking in your sleep.
                                What did you say? It’s weird for you to be dreaming with
                                your eyes wide open—standing, talking, moving, but sound
                                asleep.Good Sebastian, you’re the one who’s
                                sleeping if you let this opportunity pass you by without acting on
                                it.You’re snoring, but it sounds like you’re
                                talking. There’s meaning in your snoring.
