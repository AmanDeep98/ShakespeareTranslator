                                no hopeThat he’s undrowned.    Oh, out of that
                                “no hope”What great hope have you! No hope that way isAnother way so high a hope that evenAmbition cannot pierce a wink beyond,But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with meThat Ferdinand is drowned?    He’s
                                gone.      Then,
                                tell me,Who’s the next heir of Naples?    Claribel.She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwellsTen leagues beyond man’s life; she that from NaplesCan have no note, unless the sun were post—The man i' th' moon’s too
                                slow—till newborn chinsBe rough and razorable; she that from whomWe all were sea-swallowed, though some cast again,And by that destiny to perform an actWhereof what’s past is prologue, what to comeIn yours and my discharge.    What stuff is
                                this? How say you?'Tis true, my brother’s
                                daughter’s Queen of Tunis,So is she heir of Naples, ’twixt which regionsThere is some space.    A space whose
                                every cubitSeems to cry out, “How shall that ClaribelMeasure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,#LBSFORGOLDYes, I’m sure he’s dead. I’ve got
                                no hope that he survived.But in that “no hope” there are great hopes
                                for you! That “no hope” means
                                you’re on the way to glory so brilliant you
                                couldn’t even imagine it, no matter how ambitious you
                                were. Do you agree that Ferdinand must have drowned?He’s dead.So, in that case, tell me who’s next in line to inherit
                                the kingdom of Naples?Claribel, his daughter.The one who’s now Queen of Tunis, living at the edge of
                                the world, out of reach of mail service. It takes a letter longer to

                                survived—she was destined to give us an opportunity that
                                we are destined to act on.What in the world are you talking about? It’s true that
                                my brother’s daughter is Queen of Tunis, and heir of
                                Naples. And it’s true those two places are far
                            apart.So far that every foot of distance between them seems to shout,
                                “It’s too far for Claribel to come back to
