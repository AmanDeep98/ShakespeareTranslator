What if he had said “widower
                                Æneas” too? Good Lord, how you take it!“Widow Dido” said you? You make me study of
                                that. She was of Carthage, not of Tunis.This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.Carthage?I assure you, Carthage.His word is more than the miraculous harp. He hath raised the wall
                                and houses too.What impossible matter will he make easy next?I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it
                                his son for an apple.And sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more
                            islands.Ay.Why, in good time.
(to
                                ALONSO) Sir, we were talking that our
                                garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
                                of your daughter, who is now queen.#LBSFORGOLDNext thing you know, he’ll be saying
                                “widower Aeneas.”“Widow Dido,” did you say? I’m
                                not sure about that. Dido was from Carthage, not Tunis.
TunisGonzalo is mistaken in identifying Carthage with Tunis.Tunis 
was Carthage, sir.Carthage?I’m telling you, it was Carthage.Gonzalo is a miracle-worker. If he says Carthage was here, then
                                Carthage must be here.What miracle will he work next?I think he’ll carry this island home in his pocket and
                                give it to his son like an apple.And then throw the seeds in the sea, to make more islands
                            grow.Yes indeed. Absolutely, yes indeed.
(to
                                ALONSO) Sir, we were saying that our
                                clothes seem just as fresh as they did when we attended the wedding
                                of your daughter, who’s now queen of Tunis.
