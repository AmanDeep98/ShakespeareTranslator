O, touch me not. I am not Stephano, but a cramp.You’d be king o' th' isle,
                                sirrah?I should have been a sore one then.

This is a strange thing as e'er I looked on.He is as disproportioned in his mannersAs in his shape.—(to
                                CALIBAN) Go, sirrah, to my cell.Take with you your companions. As you lookTo have my pardon, trim it handsomely.Ay, that I will. And I’ll be wise hereafterAnd seek for grace. What a thrice-double assWas I, to take this drunkard for a godAnd worship this dull fool!     Go to,
                                away.

Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.Or stole it, rather.Sir, I invite your highness and your trainTo my poor cell, where you shall take your restFor this one night, which—part of
                                it—I’ll wasteWith such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make itGo quick away: the story of my lifeAnd the particular accidents gone bySince I came to this isle. And in the mornI’ll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,Where I have hope to see the nuptialOf these our dear-belovèd solemnized,And thence retire me to my Milan, whereEvery third thought shall be my grave.#LBSFORGOLDOh, don’t touch me. I’m not Stephano,
                                I’m a walking cramp.You wanted to be king of the island, sir?I would’ve been a sore king then.
(pointing at
                                CALIBAN) This is the strangest thing
                                I ever saw in my life.He’s as ugly in his manners as he is in
                                appearance.—(to
                                CALIBAN) Go, sir, to my room, and
                                take your companions with you. If you want me to forgive you, make
                                it neat and tidy.I will indeed. And after this I’ll be good and hope you
                                forgive me. What an idiot I was to think this drunkard was a god and
                                to worship such a stupid fool!Go away, now.
(to STEPHANO
                                and
                                TRINCULO) Go, and put your garbage
                                back where you found it.Or stole it, rather.Sir, I invite your highness and your entourage to my little room,
                                where you can sleep tonight. But for this evening—part of
                                it, at least—I’ll tell you tales to make the
                                time pass quickly. I’ll narrate the story of my life, and
                                give you all the details of what happened to me since I first came
                                to this island. And in the morning I’ll take you to your
                                ship and we’ll sail to Naples, where I hope to see this
                                loving couple married. After that I’ll retire to Milan,
                                where I’ll contemplate my death, which is soon to
                            come.
