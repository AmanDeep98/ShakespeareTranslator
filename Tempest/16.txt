     'Tis
                                far off,And rather like a dream than an assuranceThat my remembrance warrants. Had I notFour or five women once that tended me?Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is itThat this lives in thy mind? What seest thou elseIn the dark backward and abysm of time?If thou rememberest aught ere thou camest here,How thou camest here thou mayst.      But
                                that I do not.Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,Thy father was the Duke of Milan andA prince of power.    Sir, are not you
                                my father?Thy mother was a piece of virtue andShe said thou wast my daughter. And thy fatherWas Duke of Milan, and thou his only heirAnd princess no worse issued.     Oh,
                                the heavens!What foul play had we that we came from thence?Or blessè was ’t we did?    Both, both, my
                                girl.By foul play, as thou sayst, were we heaved thence,But blessedly holp hither.#LBSFORGOLDMy memory is hazy, more like a dream than a recollection.
                                Didn’t I use to have four or five women taking care of
                                me?Indeed you did, and more besides, Miranda. But how is it possible
                                that you still remember this, through all the darkness of the past?
                                If you remember your life before you came here, you may also
                                remember how you got here.No, that I don’t remember.Twelve years ago, Miranda, twelve years ago your father was the
                                Duke of Milan, a powerful prince.Aren’t you my father?Your mother was extremely virtuous, and she said you were my
                                daughter. And your father was Duke of Milan, and you were his heir,
                                a princess.Good lord! What evil things were done to us that we were driven
                                here? Or was it a blessing that we came here?Both, both, my girl. We were pushed out of power by evil deeds, as
                                you call them. But we were blessed in being helped toward this
                                island.
