We would so, and then go a-batfowling.

                                GONZALO) Nay, good my lord, be not
                                angry.No, I warrant you. I will not adventure my discretion so weakly.
                                Will you laugh me asleep, for I am very heavy?Go sleep, and hear us.What, all so soon asleep? I wish mine eyesWould with themselves shut up my thoughts. I findThey are inclined to do so.     Please
                                you, sir,Do not omit the heavy offer of it.It seldom visits sorrow. When it doth,It is a comforter.   We two, my lord,Will guard your person while you take your restAnd watch your safety.     Thank
                                you. Wondrous heavy.#LBSFORGOLDThat’s right, and then after we fixed the moon,
                                we’d go bird-hunting.
(to
                                GONZALO) Don’t be angry
                                with us, my lord.I’m not. I’ve got good judgment, and I know
                                you’ve got nothing against me. Will you laugh me to
                                sleep? I’m feeling very sleepy.Go to sleep, and listen to us laughing.What, everybody falls asleep so fast? I wish I could sleep
                                too—it would stop me from thinking. Come to think of it,
                                I am feeling sleepy.In that case you should sleep. People in grief need a good sleep.
                                It doesn’t come to them often, but when it does come they
                                should enjoy it.The two of us will guard you while you sleep, my lord, and keep
                                you safe.Thank you. I’m terribly sleepy.
