Thou art inclined to sleep. 'Tis a good dullness,And give it way. I know thou canst not choose.Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.Approach, my Ariel, come.All hail, great master! Grave sir, hail! I comeTo answer thy best pleasure, be ’t to fly,To swim, to dive into the fire, to rideOn the curled clouds. To thy strong bidding, taskAriel and all his quality.    Hast thou, spirit,Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee?To every article.I boarded the king’s ship. Now on the beak,Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,I flamed amazement. Sometime I’d divide,And burn in many places. On the topmast,The yards, and bowsprit would I flame distinctly,Then meet and join. Jove’s lightning, the precursorsO' th' dreadful thunderclaps, more momentaryAnd sight-outrunning were not. The fire and cracksOf sulfurous roaring the most mighty NeptuneSeem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,Yea, his dread trident shake.     My
                                brave spirit!Who was so firm, so constant, that this coilWould not infect his reason?#LBSFORGOLDYou look sleepy. It’s a nice hazy feeling, so give in
                                to it. I know you have no choice. Come on, servant, come. I’m ready now. Come here,
                                Ariel.Humble greetings, great master! Worthy sir, greetings! Your wish
                                is my command, whatever you want. If you want me to fly, to swim, to
                                jump into fire, to ride the clouds in the sky, Ariel will get right
                                to the task.Spirit, did you carry out the storm just as I ordered?Down to the last detail. I boarded the king’s ship, and
                                in every corner of it, from the deck to the cabins, I made everyone
                                astonished and terrified. Sometimes I appeared in many places at
                                once. On the top sail and main mast I flamed in different spots,
                                then I came together into a single flame. I flashed about faster
                                than lightning. The fire and deafening cracks seemed to overwhelm
                                even the god of the sea himself, making him tremble
                            underwater.Good spirit! Who could ever be so steady and strong that a
                                disturbance like that wouldn’t make him crazy?
