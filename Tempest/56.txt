      Sir,
                                have pity,I’ll be his surety.  Silence! One word moreShall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What,An advocate for an imposter? Hush,Thou think’st there is no more such shapes as he,Having seen but him and Caliban. Foolish wench,To th' most of men this is a CalibanAnd they to him are angels.    My affectionsAre then most humble. I have no ambitionTo see a goodlier man.

                                FERDINAND)   Come
                                on. Obey.Thy nerves are in their infancy againAnd have no vigor in them.    So they are.My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.My father’s loss, the weakness which I feel,The wrack of all my friends, nor this man’s threats,To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,Might I but through my prison once a dayBehold this maid. All corners else o' th'
                                earthLet liberty make use of. Space enoughHave I in such a prison.

                                on.
(aside) Thou hast done well, fine
                                Ariel!
(to
                                FERDINAND)    Follow
                                me.
(to
                                ARIEL) Hark what thou else shalt do
                                me.#LBSFORGOLDFather, take pity on him. I’ll guarantee his goodness
                                myself.Quiet! If you say one more word, I’ll punish you, maybe
                                even hate you. You’re defending an impostor? Be quiet.
                                You think he’s special, since you’ve only ever
                                seen him and Caliban. Foolish girl, in the eyes of most people this
                                man’s a Caliban, and compared to him, they’re
                                angels.Then my love is humble. I don’t feel any urge to see a
                                more handsome man than this one.
(to
                                FERDINAND) Come on. Obey my orders.
                                Your muscles are all limp and lifeless.That’s true, they are. My strength is all gone, as if
                                in a dream. The death of my father, my physical weakness, the loss
                                of all my friends, the threats of this man who’s taken me
                                prisoner—all that would be easy for me to take, if only I
                                could look through my prison windows once a day and see this girl. I
                                don’t need any more freedom than that. A prison like that
                                would give me enough liberty.
(to himself) It’s
                                working! (to
                                FERDINAND) Come on.

                                You’ve done well,
                                Ariel. (to

                                you’ll do for me next.
