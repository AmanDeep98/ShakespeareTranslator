Which spongy April at thy hest betrimsTo make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom groves,Whose shadow the dismissèd bachelor loves,Being lass-lorn; thy pole-clipped vineyard;And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky hard,Where thou thyself dost air—the Queen o'
                                th' Sky,Whose watery arch and messenger am I,Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,Here on this grass plot, in this very place,To come and sport. Her peacocks fly amain.Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.Hail, many-colored messenger, that ne'erDost disobey the wife of Jupiter;Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowersDiffusest honey drops, refreshing showers;And with each end of thy blue bow dost crownMy bosky acres and my unshrubbed down,Rich scarf to my proud earth. Why hath thy queenSummoned me hither to this short-grassed green?A contract of true love to celebrate,And some donation freely to estateOn the blessed lovers.     Tell
                                me, heavenly bow,If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,Do now attend the queen? Since they did plotThe means that dusky Dis my daughter got,Her and her blind boy’s scandaled companyI have forsworn.#LBSFORGOLDsheep nibble, the furrows that April covers with flowers for
                                nymphs to make crowns with. You must leave the groves where the
                                disappointed bachelor lurks, rejected by his love, and the
                                well-pruned vineyards, and the rocky seashore.You must leave these places and hurry here to this grassy spot, to
                                entertain Juno.Greetings to you, rainbow messenger, who never disobeys Juno, wife
                                of Jupiter; with your golden wings you sprinkle dewdrops and
                                refreshing showers on my flowers, and arch your colored bow over my
                                wooded fields and grassy meadows, like a beautiful scarf to decorate
                                my earth. Why has your queen, Juno, called me here to this grassy
                                spot?To celebrate a marriage of true love, and give a gift to the
                                lovers.Tell me, rainbow, do you know if either Venus, the goddess of
                                love, or her son, Cupid, is accompanying Queen Juno? Ever since
                                Venus and her blind son plotted a way for the god of the underworld
                                to steal my daughter away for half the year, I swore I’d
                                never speak to them again.
