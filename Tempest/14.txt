      'Tis
                                timeI should inform thee farther. Lend thy handAnd pluck my magic garment from me.      So,Lie there, my art.—Wipe thou thine eyes. Have comfort.The direful spectacle of the wrack, which touchedThe very virtue of compassion in thee,I have with such provision in mine artSo safely ordered that there is no soul—No, not so much perdition as an hairBetid to any creature in the vessel—Which thou heard’st cry, which thou sawst sink. Sit
                                down.For thou must now know farther.     You
                                have oftenBegun to tell me what I am, but stoppedAnd left me to a bootless inquisition,Concluding, “Stay. Not yet.”     The
                                hour’s now come.The very minute bids thee ope thine ear.Obey and be attentive. Canst thou rememberA time before we came unto this cell?I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast notOut three years old.    Certainly, sir, I
                                can.By what? By any other house or person?Of anything the image tell me thatHath kept with thy remembrance.#LBSFORGOLDIt’s time for you to know the whole story. Give me a
                                hand and help me off with this magic cloak.
(to the cloak) So, lie there, my
                                magic. (to
                                MIRANDA) Wipe your eyes. Take
                                comfort. I arranged the horrible sight of this shipwreck, which
                                moved you to such pity, so carefully that not a single person was
                                hurt—no, not so much as a hair on anyone’s
                                head was destroyed in the ship that you saw sink. Sit down.
                                It’s time for you to know more.
                                (they sit)You’ve often started to tell me who I am, but then
                                suddenly stopped, leaving me asking questions that never get
                                answered, telling me, “Wait. Not yet.”Well, the time has come. This is the moment for you to listen hard
                                and pay close attention. Can you remember the time before you came
                                to live in this shack? I doubt it, since you weren’t even
                                three at the time.Sure I can, father.What do you remember? A house, a person? Tell me anything you
                                remember.
