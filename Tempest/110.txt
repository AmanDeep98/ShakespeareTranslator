There be some sports are painful, and their laborDelight in them sets off. Some kinds of basenessAre nobly undergone. And most poor mattersPoint to rich ends. This my mean taskWould be as heavy to me as odious, butThe mistress which I serve quickens what’s deadAnd makes my labors pleasures. Oh, she isTen times more gentle than her father’s crabbed,And he’s composed of harshness. I must removeSome thousands of these logs and pile them up,Upon a sore injunction. My sweet mistressWeeps when she sees me work, and says such basenessHad never like executor. I forget,But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labors,Most busiest when I do it.     Alas
                                now, pray you,Work not so hard. I would the lightning hadBurnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile!Pray, set it down and rest you. When this burns,'Twill weep for having wearied you. My fatherIs hard at study. Pray now, rest yourself.He’s safe for these three hours.#LBSFORGOLDSome games are painful, but their discomfort makes them more fun.
                                Some kinds of lowly activities are done for noble reasons. And you
                                can do poor things that lead to rich results. This hard work would
                                be boring and nasty to me, but I’m working for a mistress
                                who makes me enjoy my labor. Oh, she’s ten times nicer
                                than her father is mean, and he’s the height of
                                crabbiness. I have thousands of logs to take away and pile up, on
                                strict orders from him. My sweet darling cries when she sees me work
                                and tells me that such a wonderful man never performed such lowly
                                tasks before. These sweet thoughts relieve me and refresh me,
                                especially when I’m slaving away busily.Now, please, I beg you, don’t work so hard. I wish the
                                lightning had burned up all those logs that you’ve been
                                ordered to stack! Please put that log down and rest a while. When
                                this wood burns, it’ll weep for making you tired. My
                                father’s studying hard, so he won’t see you.
                                So please rest. We’re safe from my father for at least
                                three hours.
