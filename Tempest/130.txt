Ay, on mine honor.
(aside) This will I tell my
                            master.Thou makest me merry. I am full of pleasure.Let us be jocund. Will you troll the catchYou taught me but whilere?At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any reason.—Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
(sings)
 Flout 'em and scout
                                    'em, And scout 'em and
                                    flout 'em. Thought is free.That’s not the tune.What is this same?This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture of
                            Nobody.If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness. If thou
beest a
                                devil, take ’t as thou list.
O, forgive me my sins!He that dies pays all debts.—I defy
                                thee!—Mercy upon us!Art thou afeard?#LBSFORGOLDYes, I swear.
(to himself) I’ll tell
                                my master this.You make me so happy. I’m full of joy. Let’s
                                be light-hearted. Will you sing the tune you taught me just a little
                                while ago?I’ll do anything you ask, monster, anything
                                reasonable.—Come on, Trinculo, let’s sing.
                                (he sings)
 Dismiss 'em and ziss
                                    'em
 And diss 'em and
                                    dismiss 'em. Thought is free.That’s not the tune I had in mind.What’s this song?That’s the melody, played by Nobody.
(to the invisible musician) If
                                you’re a man, then let us see what you look like. If
                                you’re a devil, then go to hell.Oh, forgive all my sins!Dead men have to pay their debts.—I challenge
                                you!—God help us.Are you scared?
