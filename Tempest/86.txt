And let Sebastian wake.” Say this were deathThat now hath seized them. Why, they were no worseThan now they are. There be that can rule NaplesAs well as he that sleeps, lords that can prateAs amply and unnecessarilyAs this Gonzalo. I myself could makeA chough of as deep chat. Oh, that you boreThe mind that I do, what a sleep were thisFor your advancement! Do you understand me?Methinks I do.  And how does your contentTender your own good fortune?    I rememberYou did supplant your brother Prospero.      True.And look how well my garments sit upon me,Much feater than before. My brother’s servantsWere then my fellows. Now they are my men.But, for your conscience?Ay, sir. Where lies that? If ’twere a kibe,'Twould put me to my slipper. But I feel notThis deity in my bosom. Twenty consciences,That stand ’twixt me and Milan, candied be theyAnd melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,No better than the earth he lies upon,If he were that which now he’s
                                like—that’s dead—Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,To the perpetual wink for aye might putThis ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who#LBSFORGOLDchance to start living.” If these sleeping men were
                                dead instead of sleeping, they’d be no worse off than
                                they are now. There are a lot of men who can rule Naples just as
                                well as this sleeping guy here can. There are a lot of men who
                                babble nonsense as well as Gonzalo. I could do it myself. Oh, I wish
                                you understood what I’m
                                saying—you’d see how you’re missing
                                out on a great opportunity for yourself! Do you even get what
                                I’m saying?I think I do.And does this prospect of good fortune make you happy?I remember you took the throne from your brother Prospero.Yes I did, and look how good I look in my new role—much
                                better than before. My brother’s servants used to be my
                                equals. Now they work for me.But what about your guilty conscience?Yes. What guilty conscience? I don’t feel anything. If
                                my feet were cold, I’d put my slippers on, but I
                                don’t feel any pangs of guilt. If there were twenty
                                guilty consciences between me and the dukedom, they’d
                                melt away to nothing before they caused me any trouble.
                                Here’s your brother sleeping, worth no more than the dirt
                                he’s lying on. If he were as dead as he appears to be
                                now—and I could quickly make him dead with this sword of
                                mine—he wouldn’t stand in our way. As
