Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of MilanAnd his brave son being twain.
(aside)   The
                                Duke of MilanAnd his more braver daughter could control theeIf now ’twere fit to do ’t! At the first
                                sightThey have changed eyes.—Delicate Ariel,I’ll set thee free for this.
(to
                                FERDINAND)
  A word, good sir.I fear you have done yourself some wrong. A word.
(aside) Why speaks my father so
                                ungently? ThisIs the third man that e'er I saw, the firstThat e'er I sighed for. Pity move my fatherTo be inclined my way!
(to
                                MIRANDA)
    Oh, if a virgin,And your affection not gone forth, I’ll make youThe queen of Naples.  Soft, sir! One word more.
(aside)
They are both in either’s powers, but this swift
                                businessI must uneasy make lest too light winningMake the prize light.
(to
                                FERDINAND)
   One word more. I charge theeThat thou attend me. Thou dost here usurpThe name thou owest not, and hast put thyselfUpon this island as a spy to win itFrom me, the lord on ’t.No, as I am a man!#LBSFORGOLDYes, indeed, and all the King’s men, the Duke of Milan
                                and his fine son too.
(to himself) The real Duke of Milan
                                and his far finer daughter could beat you in a heartbeat, if it were
                                the right time. They’ve fallen in love at first
                                sight!—Wonderful Ariel, I’ll set you free for
                                doing such good work here. (to
                                FERDINAND) Could I have a word with
                                you, sir? I’m afraid you’ve made a mistake.
                                Just a word.
(to herself) Why is my father
                                speaking to him so rudely? This is the third man I’ve
                                ever seen in my life, and the first one I’ve felt
                                romantic feelings for. I hope my father takes pity on me and treats
                                him well for my sake!Oh, if you’re a virgin, and you haven’t
                                given your heart to another man, then I’ll make you the
                                queen of Naples.Hang on, sir! Just a moment.
                                (to
                                himself)
                                They’re both in love. But I need to cause a little
                                trouble between them, or else they’ll never appreciate
                                the value of their love. (to
                                FERDINAND) I need a word with you,
                                sir. I order you to listen to me. You’re calling yourself
                                by a name that doesn’t belong to you. You’ve
                                come onto this island as a spy, to snatch it away from
                                me—I’m the rightful lord of it.No, I swear, that’s not true!
