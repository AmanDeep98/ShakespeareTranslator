Now let me see if I can conster it. Hic ibat Simois, I know you
                                not, hic est Sigeia tellus, I trust you not, Hic steterat Priami,
                                take heed he hear us not, regia, presume not, celsa
                                senis, despair not.
(as
                                LITIO) Madam, ’tis now in
                                tune.
(as
                                CAMBIO)
                                     All but
                                the base.
(as
                                LITIO) The base is right;
                                ’tis the base knave that jars.
(aside) How fiery and forward our
                                pedant is!Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love.
Pedascule, I’ll watch you
                                better yet.
(to
                                LUCENTIO) In time I may believe, yet
                                I mistrust.Mistrust it not, for sure AeacidesWas Ajax, called so from his grandfather.I must believe my master; else, I promise you,I should be arguing still upon that doubt.But let it rest.—Now, Litio, to you.Good master, take it not unkindly, pray,That I have been thus pleasant with you both.

You may go walk, and give me leave awhile.My lessons make no music in three parts.#LBSFORGOLDNow let me see if I can translate it.
                                Hic ibat Simois, I don’t
                                know you, hic est Sigeia tellus, I
                                don’t trust you,
                                Hic steterat Priami, don’t
                                let him hear you, regia,
                                don’t take anything for granted,
                                celsa senis, don’t give
                            up.
(as
                                LITIO) Madam, now it really is in
                                tune.
(as
                                CAMBIO) All but the low note.
(as
                                LITIO) The low note’s fine;
                                it’s this low-minded dog that’s out of tune!
                                (to himself) How touchy and insistent
                                this fellow is! I’m beginning to think he’s wooing
                                my darling. Little professor! I’ll have to keep an eye on
                                you.
(to
                                LUCENTIO) In time I may come to
                                believe you, but I’m wary.There’s no need to be, really, for—
                                (he breaks off, seeing that HORTENSIO
                                is listening, and pretends to go back to the Latin lesson)—“Aeacides”
                                is just another name for Ajax. He gets it from his
                            grandfather.You’re my teacher, so I must believe you. Otherwise, I
                                would have to argue the point with you. But let it
                                go.—Now, Litio, it’s your turn. I hope, sir,
                                that you’re not angry that I’ve been equally
                                attentive to you both!
(as
                                LITIO, to
                                LUCENTIO) You can take a break. Leave
                                us alone, why don’t you? I don’t teach music for a
                                threesome.
