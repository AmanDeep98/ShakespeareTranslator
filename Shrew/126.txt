Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old jerkin, a pair of
                                old breeches thrice turned, a pair of boots that have been candle
                                cases, one buckled, another laced; an old rusty sword ta'en
                                out of the town armory, with a broken hilt and chapeless; with two
                                broken points; his horse hipped, with an old mothy saddle and
                                stirrups of no kindred, besides possessed with the glanders and like
                                to mose in the chine, troubled with the lampass, infected with the
                                fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with spavins, rayed with yellows,
                                past cure of the fives, stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn
                                with the bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten, near-legged
                                before and with a half-checked bit and a headstall of sheeps
                                leather, which, being restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath
                                been often burst, and now repaired with knots, one girth six times
                                pieced, and a woman’s crupper of velour, which hath two
                                letters for her name fairly set down in studs, and here and there
                                pieced with packthread.Who comes with him?O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned like the horse;
                                with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose on the other,
                                gartered with a red and blue list; an old hat and the humor of forty
                                fancies pricked in ’t for a feather. A monster, a very
                                monster in apparel, and not like a Christian footboy or a
                                gentleman’s lackey.

'Tis some odd humor pricks him to this fashion,Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-appareled.I am glad he’s come, howsoe'er he comes.#LBSFORGOLDWell, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old vest, a pair of
                                old pants turned inside out, unmatched boots that have been used as
                                spittoons, one buckled, the other laced; a rusty old sword from the
                                town armory with a broken hilt and no scabbard. He’s got on
                                worn-out garters and is riding a swayback old horse with a
                                moth-eaten saddle, stirrups from two different sets, a bad hip,
                                swollen glands, lockjaw, leg ulcers, bedsores, arthritis, jaundice,
                                a hernia, hives, worms, cancer, a mossy overbite, and post-nasal
                                drip. He’s knock-kneed too. His bit’s lopsided and
                                his cardboard bridle, which breaks when you pull on it, is taped in
                                a few places. The saddle strap is made out of patchwork, and the
                                strap that goes under his tail to keep the saddle in place is
                                velvet, with the initials of some woman written in studs.Who comes with him?Just his servant, sir—pretty much got up like the
                                horse, with a linen stocking on one leg and a big woolen booty on
                                the other, a pair of red and blue garters, and an old hat with
                                something no one’s ever seen before where the feather
                                should be. He’s dressed like a freak, a total freak, and
                                not at all like a proper footman or a gentleman’s
                            valet.
(as
                                LUCENTIO) He must be in a strange
                                mood to go in for this fashion—though from time to time
                                he has been known to dress
                            down.I am glad he’s coming, however he’s
                            dressed.
