Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready.I fly, Biondello. But they may chance to need thee at home.Therefore leave us.Nay, faith, I’ll see the church a' your back,
                                and then come back to my master’s as soon as I can.I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.Sir, here’s the door. This is Lucentio’s house.My father’s bears more toward the marketplace.Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.You shall not choose but drink before you go.I think I shall command your welcome here,And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.They’re busy within. You were best knock louder.#LBSFORGOLDQuickly and quietly, sir. The priest is already there.We’re off, Biondello. But they may need you at home, so
                                you go on back.I’ll see them safely married first and then hurry back to
                                my master’s.I wonder why Cambio hasn’t shown up in all this
                            time.Here is the door, sir. This is Lucentio’s house. My
                                father-in-law lives closer to the marketplace. That’s where
                                I’m going now, so I’ll leave you here.You must not go without having a drink first. I think I may
                                presume to welcome you, and they’re probably preparing some
                                kind of feast to welcome me.They’re pretty busy in there. You’d better knock
                                louder.
