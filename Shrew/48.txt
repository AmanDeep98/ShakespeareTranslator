Tranio, let’s go. One thing more rests, that thyself
                                execute,
to make one among these wooers. If thou ask me why,
sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty.
My lord, you nod. You do not mind the play.Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely. Comes
there any more of it?
My lord, ’tis but begun.'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady. Would’twere done.#LBSFORGOLDTranio, let’s go. One last thing, and this is up to you.
                                You’ll have to woo Bianca like the rest. Don’t ask
                                why. Just trust me—I know what I’m
                            doing.
(to
                                SLY) My lord, you’re falling
                                asleep. You’re not paying attention to the play.No, no. I am. Really. Very impressive. Is there any more, or is
                                that it?
(speaking as
                                SLY's wife) My lord,
                                we’ve only just got started.And what an excellent piece of work it is, too, madam lady! I wish
                                it were over.
