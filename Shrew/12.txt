Such duty to the drunkard let him doWith soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,And say, “What is ’t your Honor will command,Wherein your lady and your humble wifeMay show her duty and make known her love?”And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,And with declining head into his bosom,Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyedTo see her noble lord restored to health,Who for this seven years hath esteemed himNo better than a poor and loathsome beggar.And if the boy have not a woman’s giftTo rain a shower of commanded tears,An onion will do well for such a shift,Which in a napkin being close conveyedShall in despite enforce a watery eye.See this dispatched with all the haste thou canst:Anon I’ll give thee more instructions.I know the boy will well usurp the grace,Voice, gait, and action of a gentlewoman.I long to hear him call the drunkard
                                “husband,”And how my men will stay themselves from laughterWhen they do homage to this simple peasant.I’ll in to counsel them. Haply my presenceMay well abate the over-merry spleenWhich otherwise would grow into extremes.#LBSFORGOLDThat’s just how I want him to behave toward the drunkard,
                                speaking in a low, soft voice and in humble, courteous tones and
                                saying fancy stuff like, “What does your Honor wish to
                                command your lady, your humble wife, to do to show her devotion and
                                demonstrate her love?” Tell him to give the drunkard
                                fond embraces and alluring kisses, and lay his head on the other
                                man’s breast, weeping like a woman overjoyed to see a
                                husband restored to health who for the last seven years has imagined
                                he was no better than a poor, pathetic beggar. The boy may lack a
                                woman’s gift for weeping at will, so it might be good to
                                have an onion handy, hidden in a handkerchief. That’ll make
                                his eyes stream. Get this done as quickly as you can. I’ll
                                give you more instructions later.I know the boy will be a convincing gentlewoman, taking up her
                                exact walk and talk and gentle gestures. I can’t wait to
                                hear him call the drunkard “husband,” and to
                                watch my men smother their laughter as they pay their respects to
                                this simple peasant. I’ll go and coach them. My presence
                                may put a damper on their high spirits, which might otherwise get
                                out of control.
