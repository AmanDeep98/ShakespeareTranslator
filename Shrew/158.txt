As he forth walkèd on his way:—
A servant tries to take off
                                PETRUCHIO’s boots.

(singing)
It was a friar in robes of gray, who walked along the road one day:—(a servant tries to take off
                                PETRUCHIO’s boots) Stop, you
                                moron! You’re twisting my foot! Take that, and see you do a
                                better job with the other one.
                                (he strikes the servant) Be happy,
                                Kate!—Bring me some water! Where’s my spaniel
                                Troilus? Hey boy, go tell my cousin Ferdinand to get in here.You’ll love this guy, Kate—anyway,
                                you’d better! Where are my slippers? Can we have some water
                                please here?—Come and wash, Kate, make yourself at home. Son of a bitch, you
                                spilled it!
                            (he strikes the servant)
Take it easy! Please! It was just an accident!
