Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for youI know you think to dine with me todayAnd have prepared great store of wedding cheer,But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,And therefore here I mean to take my leave.Is ’t possible you will away tonight?I must away today, before night come.Make it no wonder. If you knew my business,You would entreat me rather go than stay.And, honest company, I thank you all,That have beheld me give away myselfTo this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife.Dine with my father, drink a health to me,For I must hence, and farewell to you all.

                                expected me to stay to dinner and have prepared a celebratory feast,
                                but as it happens I’m called away. So let me say
                            goodbye.You’re not thinking of leaving tonight, surely?Not tonight—today. If you knew the reason,
                                you’d understand and would urge me to go rather than stay.

                                sweet, virtuous wife. Dine with my father and drink a health to me.
