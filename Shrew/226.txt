Here’s packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!Where is that damnèd villain, Tranio,That faced and braved me in this matter so?Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?Cambio is changed into Lucentio.Love wrought these miracles. Bianca’s loveMade me exchange my state with Tranio,While he did bear my countenance in the town,And happily I have arrivèd at the lastUnto the wishèd haven of my bliss.What Tranio did, myself enforced him to.Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.I’ll slit the villain’s nose that would have
                                sent me to the jail.But do you hear, sir, have you married my daughter
without asking my goodwill?
Fear not, Baptista, we will content you. Go to. But I will in
to be revenged for this villany.
And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.Look not pale, Bianca. Thy father will not frown.#LBSFORGOLDQuite the conspiracy! We’ve all been duped.Where is that damned wretch, Tranio, who defied me in such a
                                disgraceful manner?Say, isn’t this the Latin master Cambio?Cambio is transformed into Lucentio.It was love that performed these miracles. Bianca’s love
                                made me trade places with Tranio while he masqueraded as me around
                                town. And now, finally, I’ve arrived happily at the
                                blissful haven where I longed to be. What Tranio did, he did at my
                                command. So pardon him, dear father, for my sake.No, I’ll slit the nose of the villain who would have sent
                                me to jail.But sir, have you married my daughter without my consent?Don’t worry, Baptista, you’ll be perfectly
                                satisfied. You’ll see. Now I’m going inside to see
                                that someone pays for this mischief.Me too—to see how far the mischief went.Don’t worry, Bianca. Your father won’t be
                            angry.
