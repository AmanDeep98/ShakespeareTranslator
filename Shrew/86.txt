Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed.But be thou armed for some unhappy words.Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,That shakes not, though they blow perpetually.How now, my friend, why dost thou look so pale?
(as
                                LITIO) For fear, I promise you, if I
                                look pale.What, will my daughter prove a good musician?I think she’ll sooner prove a soldier.Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?Why, no, for she hath broke the lute to me.I did but tell her she mistook her frets,And bowed her hand to teach her fingering,When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,“'Frets' call you
                                these?” quoth she. “I’ll fume with
                                them!”And with that word she struck me on the head,And through the instrument my pate made way,#LBSFORGOLDWell, good luck! I hope you’re successful. But prepare
                                yourself for some unpleasantness.I’ll be completely prepared. Mountains don’t
                                tremble, however much the wind may blow!Gracious! Why so pale, my friend?
(as
                                LITIO) I would have to say from
                            fear.Will my daughter be a good musician, do you think?I think she’ll be a better soldier. She may be good with
                                firearms. Never lutes.You don’t think you can teach her?No, but she’s taught me a thing or two! All I said was
                                that she was using the wrong frets and tried to adjust her
                                fingering. And she jumps up and says, “Frets?
                                I’ll give you frets!” With that, she clobbers
                                me with the lute so that my head goes right through,
