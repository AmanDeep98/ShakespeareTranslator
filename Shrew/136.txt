Tut, she’s a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!I’ll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priestShould ask if Katherine should be his wife,“Ay, by gogs wouns!” quoth he, and swore
                                so loudThat, all amazed, the priest let fall the book,And as he stooped again to take it up,The mad-brained bridegroom took him such a cuffThat down fell priest and book, and book and priest.“Now take them up,” quoth he,
                                “if any list.”
(as
                                LUCENTIO) What said the wench when he
                                rose again?Trembled and shook, for why he stamped and sworeAs if the vicar meant to cozen him.But after many ceremonies done,He calls for wine. “A health!” quoth he,
                                as ifHe had been aboard, carousing to his matesAfter a storm; quaffed off the muscatelAnd threw the sops all in the sexton’s face,Having no other reasonBut that his beard grew thin and hungerlyAnd seemed to ask him sops as he was drinking.This done, he took the bride about the neckAnd kissed her lips with such a clamorous smackThat at the parting all the church did echo.And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame,And after me, I know, the rout is coming.Such a mad marriage never was before.Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.#LBSFORGOLDWhy, she’s a lamb, a dove, a child compared to him!
                                Picture this: when the priest asked Katherine if she would have him,
                                he answered, “Hell, yes!” and swore so loud
                                that the priest drops the prayer book. Everyone froze, and as the
                                priest stooped to pick it up again the lunatic bridegroom smacked
                                him so hard that the priest and book went flying!
                                Then he said, “Now pick
                                them up—if anyone dares.”
(as
                                LUCENTIO) What did the girl say when
                                the priest got up?She trembled and shook because he stamped and swore and carried on
                                as though the vicar were trying to put something over on him.
                                Finally, the ceremony done, he called for wine. “A
                                health!” he shouted, like some sailor aboard ship,
                                carousing with his mates after a storm. Then he chugs the wine and
                                throws the dregs in the sexton’s face. Why? Because the
                                fellow’s beard looked thin, he said, and it seemed to be
                                asking him for the dregs while he was drinking. Next he slung his
                                arm around the bride’s neck and kissed her with such a
                                smack that when they parted the sound of their lips made the whole
                                church echo. That was the limit for me. I got out of there as fast
                                as I could. I know the rest of the crowd isn’t far behind
                                me. It’s disgraceful! You never saw such a mockery of a
                                marriage in your life!There go the minstrels. They’ve started up.
