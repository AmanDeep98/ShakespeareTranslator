                                hold your own, in any case,With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.I warrant you.   But, sir, here comes your boy.'Twere good he were schooled.

                                Would you like me to ring?Yes, certainly. Unless I am mistaken, Signior Baptista may
                                remember me from the Pegasus in Genoa, where we both stayed twenty
                                years ago.
(as
                                LUCENTIO) Fine, fine. Just play your
                                part and act as serious as a father should.Of course I will.But, sir, here comes your servant. Better fill him in.

                                LUCENTIO) Don’t worry about
                                him.—You there, Biondello, now act your part
                                convincingly. Behave as though this were the real Vincentio.Don’t worry about me.
(as
                                LUCENTIO) And did you take the
                                message to Baptista?I told him that your father was in Venice, and that you expected
                                him to arrive in Padua today.
