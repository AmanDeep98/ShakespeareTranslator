Say thou wilt course. Thy greyhounds are as swiftAs breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.Dost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee straightAdonis painted by a running brookAnd Cytherea all in sedges hid,Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,Even as the waving sedges play with wind.We’ll show thee Io as she was a maidAnd how she was beguileèd and surprised,As lively painted as the deed was done.Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord.Thou hast a lady far more beautifulThan any woman in this waning age.And till the tears that she hath shed for theeLike envious floods o'errun her lovely face,She was the fairest creature in the world—And yet she is inferior to none.#LBSFORGOLDIf you care to hunt rabbits, your greyhounds are as swift as

Cytherea is another name for Venus (in Greek, Aphrodite).Adonis stretched out beside a rushing brook, with Venus spying on
                                him, hidden in rushes that seem to move and undulate with her
                                lustful sighs, like grass waving in the wind.There’s one that shows Io as a maid, before she was

                                It’s so realistic, it seems to be happening right before
                                your eyes.
There’s one of DaphneDaphne was a nymph whom Apollo loved and changed into a tree as she was trying to escape from him.Daphne running through the woods, her legs so scratched by thorns
                                that Apollo himself would weep at the sight. You’ll swear
                                the blood and tears are real.You are nothing less than a lord. You have a noble wife who is
                                much more beautiful than any other woman in this declining
                            age.Before she began shedding tears all over her lovely face, she was
