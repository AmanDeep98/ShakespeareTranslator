Adieu, good neighbor.    Now I fear thee
                                not.Sirrah young gamester, your father were a foolTo give thee all and in his waning ageSet foot under thy table. Tut, a toy!An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.'Tis in my head to do my master good.I see no reason but supposed LucentioMust get a father, called “supposed
                                Vincentio”—And that’s a wonder. Fathers commonlyDo get their children. But in this case of wooing,A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.#LBSFORGOLDFarewell, good neighbor.Now I’m not worried. You there, young sport! Your father
                                would be a fool to give you all his wealth and spend his declining
                                years as a guest in your house. It’s absurd. An old Italian
                                fox is never that generous, my boy.Sneaky, dried-up old coot! We’ll see who gets the upper
                                hand! I’ve already bluffed pretty well—and
                                without even a face card. I have a mind to help my master. Clearly,
                                the fake Lucentio will have to produce a father—call him
                                “fake Vincentio”—and it will be
                                a miracle. Usually fathers produce children, not the other way
                                around. But in this case of wooing, a child shall father his own
                                father—if my wits don’t fail me.
