Mistress, your father prays you leave your booksAnd help to dress your sister’s chamber up.You know tomorrow is the wedding day.Farewell, sweet masters both. I must be gone.

                                no cause to stay.But I have cause to pry into this pedant.Methinks he looks as though he were in love.Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humbleTo cast thy wand'ring eyes on every stale,Seize thee that list! If once I find thee ranging,Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.#LBSFORGOLDMistress, your father requests that you leave your books and come
                                help decorate your sister’s room. You know tomorrow is her
                                wedding day.Farewell to both of you, dear teachers. I have to go.

                                CAMBIO) In that case, mistress,
                                there’s no reason for me to stay.But there’s reason for me to look more closely at this
                                schoolmaster. He acts like a man in love. But if Bianca is so vulgar
                                as to stoop for any man she sees, the hell with her. Whoever wants
                                her can have her. The first time I catch her straying, it’s
                                over. End of story.
