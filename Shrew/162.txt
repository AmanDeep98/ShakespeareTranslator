Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.Peter, didst ever see the like?He kills her in her own humor.Where is he?In her chamber,Making a sermon of continency to her,And rails and swears and rates, that she, poor soul,Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,And sits as one new-risen from a dream.Away, away, for he is coming hither!Thus have I politicly begun my reign,And ’tis my hope to end successfully.My falcon now is sharp and passing empty,And, till she stoop, she must not be full-gorged,For then she never looks upon her lure.Another way I have to man my haggard,To make her come and know her keeper’s call.#LBSFORGOLDCome, I’ll show you your bridal chamber.Peter, did you ever see anything like it?He’s giving her a taste of her own medicine.Where is he?In her room, lecturing her on the virtues of self-control. He
                                rants and rails and swears and she, poor thing, doesn’t
                                know how to stand or look or speak. She sits like a person
                                who’s just woken up from a dream. Look out, he’s
                                coming!Well, I’ve begun my reign with a carefully thought-out
                                plan, and I have every hope of succeeding. My falcon is now hungry
                                and unfed and must not be given enough to eat until she comes to me,
                                for if her hunger is satisfied, she’ll pay no attention to
                                the bait. I have another plan to make my bird come to me and
                                recognize her owner’s call is to keep her from
                                sleeping—
