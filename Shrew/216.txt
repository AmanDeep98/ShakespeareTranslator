(as
                                VINCENTIO) What’s he that
                                knocks as he would beat
down the gate?
Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
(as
                                VINCENTIO) He’s within, sir,
                                but not to be spoken withal.What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make 
merry withal?

(as
                                VINCENTIO) Keep your hundred pounds
                                to yourself. He 
shall need none so long as I live.

(to
                                VINCENTIO) Nay, I told you your son
                                was well beloved in 
Padua.—Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous
 circumstances, I pray you tell Signior Lucentio that his
 father is come from Pisa and is here at the door to speak with
 him.

(as
                                VINCENTIO) Thou liest. His father is
                                come from Padua
 and here looking out at the window.
Art thou his father?
(as
                                VINCENTIO) Ay, sir, so his mother
                                says, if I may believe
 her.

                                VINCENTIO) Who’s that
                                breaking down the door?Is Signior Lucentio at home, sir?
(as
                                VINCENTIO) Yes, he’s at
                                home, but he can’t be disturbed.What if a fellow were bringing him a couple of hundred pounds to
                                toss around?
(as
                                VINCENTIO) Keep your hundreds. He
                                won’t need them as long as I’m living.
(to
                                VINCENTIO) I told you your son was
                                popular in Padua. Hear that, sir? (to
                                MERCHANT) Games aside, though, would
                                you be good enough to tell Signior Lucentio that his father has
                                arrived from Pisa and stands at the door waiting to speak with
                            him?
(as
                                VINCENTIO) You lie. His father is
                                already in Padua. In fact, he’s standing right here looking
                                out the window.
You’re his father?
(as
                                VINCENTIO) Yes,
                                sir—according to his mother, if I can believe
                            her.
