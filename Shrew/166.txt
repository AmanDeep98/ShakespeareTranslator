Is ’t possible, friend Litio, that mistress BiancaDoth fancy any other but Lucentio?I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.
(as
                                LITIO) Sir, to satisfy you in what I
                                have said,Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.

                                what you read?What, master, read you? First resolve me that.
(as
                                CAMBIO) I read that I profess,
                                The Art to Love.
And may you prove, sir, master of your art.
(as
                                CAMBIO) While you, sweet dear, prove
                                mistress of my heart!
(as
                                LITIO) Quick proceeders, marry! Now,
                                tell me, I pray,You that durst swear that your mistress BiancaLoved none in the world so well as Lucentio.
(as
                                LUCENTIO) O despiteful love!
                                Unconstant womankind!I tell thee, Litio, this is wonderful!#LBSFORGOLD
(as
                                LUCENTIO) I don’t believe
                                it, Litio. It’s not possible that Bianca could prefer
                                another man to me. I’ve seen the way she behaves.
(as
                                LITIO) You want proof of what
                                I’m telling you? Stand right here and watch this
                                fellow’s “lesson.”
                                (they stand off to one side)

(as
                                CAMBIO) Well, mistress, are you
                                learning from what you’re reading?What are you reading, teacher? Answer me that first.
(as
                                CAMBIO) I’m reading the book
                                I know
                                best—

I hope you’re an expert in your field.

                                CAMBIO) Well, my dear,
                                you’re the mistress of my heart in any case!
(as
                                LITIO) Quick work for schoolwork! How
                                do you explain that? I though you said your precious Bianca loved no
                                one better than you, Lucentio!
(as
                                LUCENTIO) Oh spiteful love! Faithless
                                womanhood! It’s incredible, Litio!
