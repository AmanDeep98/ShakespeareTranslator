                                but get thee gone.—Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?Welcome! One mess is like to be your cheer.Come, sir, we will better it in Pisa.I follow you.Cambio.What sayest thou, Biondello?You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?Biondello, what of that?Faith, nothing; but 'has left me here behind to expound
                                the
meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.
I pray thee, moralize them.Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the deceiving
father of a deceitful son.
And what of him?His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.And then?The old priest at Saint Luke’s Church is at your command
at all hours.
And what of all this?#LBSFORGOLD

                                get busy.—Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
                                You’ll be welcome, though dinner will probably be only one
                                course. We’ll make it up to you in Pisa.I’ll come with you.Cambio.What is it, Biondello?You saw my master wink and laugh at you?What about it?Nothing. It’s just that he left me here behind to
                                interpret his signs and signals.Please, educate me.Here’s the deal: we’re safe on the Baptista
                                front. He’s talking with the bogus father about the bogus
                                son.And so—?You are to bring his daughter to the supper.And then?The old priest at Saint Luke’s Church is at your command
                                at all hours.And what of all this?
