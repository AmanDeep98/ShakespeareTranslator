Then show it me.Had I a glass, I would.What, you mean my face?Well aimed of such a young one.Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.Yet you are withered.    'Tis with
                                cares.     I care
                                not.Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you ’scape not so.I chafe you, if I tarry. Let me go.No, not a whit. I find you passing gentle.'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,And now I find report a very liar.For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,But slow in speech, yet sweet as springtime flowers.Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will,Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk.But thou with mildness entertain’st thy wooers,With gentle conference, soft and affable.Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?#LBSFORGOLDShow me.I would, if I had a mirror.What, you mean my face looks like a crab-apple?What a clever child he is!You know, you’re right. I probably am too young for
                            you.Maybe, but you’re wrinkled all the same.Oh, that’s with worry.Well, that doesn’t worry me.Listen, Kate! You won’t get away like that.Let me go. I’ll make you angry if I stay.No, not a bit. I find you quite gentle. I was told that you were
                                violent, proud, and sullen. But now I see that people have been
                                lying about you, for you are funny, playful, and beautifully
                                behaved, not sharp-tongued, but as sweet as flowers in springtime.
                                You haven’t got it in you to frown or look displeased or
                                bite your lip as angry women do. You don’t take pleasure in
                                bitter conversation. No, you entertain your suitors with mild and
                                gentle conversation, quiet and pleasant. Why does the world report
                                that Kate is lame?
