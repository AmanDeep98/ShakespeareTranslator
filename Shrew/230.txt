Pray you, sit down,For now we sit to chat as well as eat.Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.Padua affords nothing but what is kind.For both our sakes, I would that word were true.Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.#LBSFORGOLDFinally, at long last, we’ve reconciled our differences.
