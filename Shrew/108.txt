                                my father hath no lessThan three great argosies, besides two galliasses,And twelve tight galleys. These I will assure her,And twice as much whate'er thou offer’st
                            next.Nay, I have offered all, I have no more,And she can have no more than all I have.
(to
                                BAPTISTA) If you like me, she shall
                                have me and mine.
(as
                                LUCENTIO)
Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,By your firm promise. Gremio is outvied.I must confess your offer is the best,And, let your father make her the assurance,She is your own; else, you must pardon me.If you should die before him, where’s her dower?
(as
                                LUCENTIO) That’s but a
                                cavil: he is old, I young.And may not young men die as well as old?Well, gentlemen, I am thus resolved:On Sunday next, you knowMy daughter Katherina is to be married.

Now, on the Sunday following, shall BiancaBe bride to you, if you make this assurance.If not, to Signior Gremio.And so I take my leave, and thank you both.#LBSFORGOLD
(speaking as
                                LUCENTIO) Please, Gremio! Everyone
                                knows that my father has no less than three, huge merchant ships and
                                fourteen galleys—two large and twelve small. These also
                                I promise to Bianca—and whatever your next offer is,
                                I’ll double it.I have nothing else to offer. That’s everything I own. I
                                can’t offer her more than all I have.
                                (to
                                BAPTISTA) If you choose me, she shall
                                have me and mine.
(speaking as
                                LUCENTIO) In that case I, of all the
                                men in the world, have won the maid, by your explicit promise.
                                Gremio is outbid.I must admit your offer is the best. And provided that your father
                                will be your guarantor, she shall be yours.
                                Otherwise—forgive me, but if you should die before him,
                                what becomes of her dowry?
(speaking as
                                LUCENTIO) That’s nothing! He
                                is old, I’m young.Oh, and young men never die?Well, gentlemen, that’s my decision. As you know, next
                                Sunday my daughter Katherina is to be married.
                                (to TRANIO
                                as
                                LUCENTIO) Therefore, the Sunday
                                after, Bianca shall be married to you—if you obtain that
                                guarantee. If not, she’ll be married to Signior Gremio. And
                                so I thank you both and bid you goodbye.
