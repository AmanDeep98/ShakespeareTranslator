Why, how are we censured?Because you talk of pride now,—will you not be angry?Well, well, sir, well.Why, ’tis no great matter; for a very little thief ofoccasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:give your dispositions the reins, and be angry atyour pleasures; at the least if you take it as apleasure to you in being so. You blame Martius forbeing proud?We do it not alone, sir.I know you can do very little alone; for your helpsare many, or else your actions would grow wondroussingle: your abilities are too infant-like fordoing much alone. You talk of pride: O that youcould turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,and make but an interior survey of your good selves!O that you could!What then, sir?Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, asany in Rome.Menenius, you are known well enough too.I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one thatloves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allayingTiber in’t; said to be something imperfect infavouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-likeupon too trivial motion; one that converses morewith the buttock of the night than with the foreheadof the morning: what I think I utter, and spend mymalice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen asyou are—I cannot call you Lycurguses—if the drinkyou give me touch my palate adversely, I make acrooked face at it. I can’t say your worships havedelivered the matter well, when I find the ass incompound with the major part of your syllables: andthough I must be content to bear with those that sayyou are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly thattell you you have good faces. If you see this inthe map of my microcosm, follows it that I am knownwell enough too? what barm can your bissonconspectuities glean out of this character, if I beknown well enough too?#LBSFORGOLD
