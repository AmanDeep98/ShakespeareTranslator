O, ay, what else?Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay’d:These are a side that would be glad to haveThis true which they so seem to fear. Go home,And show no sign of fear.The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let’s home.I ever said we were i’ the wrong when we banishedhim.So did we all. But, come, let’s home.I do not like this news.Nor I.Let’s to the Capitol. Would half my wealthWould buy this for a lie!Pray, let us go.#LBSFORGOLD
