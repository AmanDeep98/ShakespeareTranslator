’Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,And bring thy news so late?Spies of the VolscesHeld me in chase, that I was forced to wheelThree or four miles about, else had I, sir,Half an hour since brought my report.Who’s yonder,That does appear as he were flay’d? O godsHe has the stamp of Martius; and I haveBefore-time seen him thus.[Within] Come I too late?The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabourMore than I know the sound of Martius’ tongueFrom every meaner man.Come I too late?Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,But mantled in your own.O, let me clip yeIn arms as sound as when I woo’d, in heartAs merry as when our nuptial day was done,And tapers burn’d to bedward!#LBSFORGOLD
