Stay: whence are you?Stand, and go back.You guard like men; ’tis well: but, by your leave,I am an officer of state, and comeTo speak with Coriolanus.From whence?From Rome.You may not pass, you must return: our generalWill no more hear from thence.You’ll see your Rome embraced with fire beforeYou’ll speak with Coriolanus.Good my friends,If you have heard your general talk of Rome,And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,My name hath touch’d your ears. It is Menenius.Be it so; go back: the virtue of your nameIs not here passable.I tell thee, fellow,The general is my lover: I have beenThe book of his good acts, whence men have readHis name unparallel’d, haply amplified;For I have ever verified my friends,Of whom he’s chief, with all the size that verityWould without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praiseHave almost stamp’d the leasing: therefore, fellow,I must have leave to pass.#LBSFORGOLD
