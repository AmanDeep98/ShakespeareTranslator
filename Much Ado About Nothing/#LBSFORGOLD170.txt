Pray you, be gone:I’ll try whether my old wit be in requestWith those that have but little: this must be patch’dWith cloth of any colour.Nay, come away.This man has marr’d his fortune.His nature is too noble for the world:He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,Or Jove for’s power to thunder. His heart’s his mouth:What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;And, being angry, does forget that everHe heard the name of death.Here’s goodly work!SECOND PATRICIAN I would they were abed!I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!Could he not speak ’em fair?Where is this viperThat would depopulate the city andBe every man himself?#LBSFORGOLD
