Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost notThink me for the man I am, necessityCommands me name myself.What is thy name?A name unmusical to the Volscians’ ears,And harsh in sound to thine.Say, what’s thy name?Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy faceBears a command in’t; though thy tackle’s torn.Thou show’st a noble vessel: what’s thy name?Prepare thy brow to frown: know’stthou me yet?I know thee not: thy name?My name is Caius Martius, who hath doneTo thee particularly and to all the VolscesGreat hurt and mischief; thereto witness mayMy surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,The extreme dangers and the drops of bloodShed for my thankless country are requitedBut with that surname; a good memory,And witness of the malice and displeasureWhich thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;The cruelty and envy of the people,Permitted by our dastard nobles, whoHave all forsook me, hath devour’d the rest;And suffer’d me by the voice of slaves to beWhoop’d out of Rome. Now this extremityHath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope-—Mistake me not—to save my life, for ifI had fear’d death, of all the men i’ the worldI would have ’voided thee, but in mere spite,To be full quit of those my banishers,Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hastA heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revengeThine own particular wrongs and stop those maimsOf shame seen through thy country, speedthee straight,And make my misery serve thy turn: so use itThat my revengeful services may proveAs benefits to thee, for I will fightAgainst my canker’d country with the spleenOf all the under fiends. But if so beThou darest not this and that to prove more fortunesThou’rt tired, then, in a word, I also amLonger to live most weary, and presentMy throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,Since I have ever follow’d thee with hate,Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country’s breast,And cannot live but to thy shame, unlessIt be to do thee service.#LBSFORGOLD
