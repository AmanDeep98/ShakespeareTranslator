Do they still fly to the Roman?I do not know what witchcraft’s in him, butYour soldiers use him as the grace ’fore meat,Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;And you are darken’d in this action, sir,Even by your own.I cannot help it now,Unless, by using means, I lame the footOf our design. He bears himself more proudlier,Even to my person, than I thought he wouldWhen first I did embrace him: yet his natureIn that’s no changeling; and I must excuseWhat cannot be amended.Yet I wish, sir,—I mean for your particular,—you had notJoin’d in commission with him; but eitherHad borne the action of yourself, or elseTo him had left it solely.I understand thee well; and be thou sure,when he shall come to his account, he knows notWhat I can urge against him. Although it seems,And so he thinks, and is no less apparentTo the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soonAs draw his sword; yet he hath left undoneThat which shall break his neck or hazard mine,Whene’er we come to our account.#LBSFORGOLD
