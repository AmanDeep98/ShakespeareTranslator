Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. Youare ambitious for poor knaves’ caps and legs: youwear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing acause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to asecond day of audience. When you are hearing amatter between party and party, if you chance to bepinched with the colic, you make faces likemummers; set up the bloody flag against allpatience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangledby your hearing: all the peace you make in theircause is, calling both the parties knaves. You area pair of strange ones.Come, come, you are well understood to be aperfecter giber for the table than a necessarybencher in the Capitol.Our very priests must become mockers, if they shallencounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. Whenyou speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth thewagging of your beards; and your beards deserve notso honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher’scushion, or to be entombed in an ass’s pack-saddle. Yet you must be saying, Martius is proud;who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessorssince Deucalion, though peradventure some of thebest of ’em were hereditary hangmen. God-den toyour worships: more of your conversation wouldinfect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastlyplebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.#LBSFORGOLD
