Let’s be calm.The people are abused; set on. This palteringBecomes not Rome, nor has CoriolanusDeserved this so dishonour’d rub, laid falselyI’ the plain way of his merit.Tell me of corn!This was my speech, and I will speak’t again—Not now, not now.Not in this heat, sir, now.Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,I crave their pardons:For the mutable, rank-scented many, let themRegard me as I do not flatter, andTherein behold themselves: I say again,In soothing them, we nourish ’gainst our senateThe cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,Which we ourselves have plough’d for, sow’d,and scatter’d,By mingling them with us, the honour’d number,Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but thatWhich they have given to beggars.Well, no more.No more words, we beseech you.#LBSFORGOLD
