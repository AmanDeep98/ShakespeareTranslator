Hark! our drumsAre bringing forth our youth. We’ll break our walls,Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn’d with rushes;They’ll open of themselves.Hark you, far off!There is Aufidius; list, what work he makesAmongst your cloven army.O, they are at it!Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!They fear us not, but issue forth their city.Now put your shields before your hearts, and fightWith hearts more proof than shields. Advance,brave Titus:They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:He that retires I’ll take him for a Volsce,And he shall feel mine edge.All the contagion of the south light on you,You shames of Rome! you herd of—Boils and plaguesPlaster you o’er, that you may be abhorr’dFurther than seen and one infect anotherAgainst the wind a mile! You souls of geese,That bear the shapes of men, how have you runFrom slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!All hurt behind; backs red, and faces paleWith flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,Or, by the fires of heaven, I’ll leave the foeAnd make my wars on you: look to’t: come on;If you’ll stand fast, we’ll beat them to their wives,As they us to our trenches followed.#LBSFORGOLD
