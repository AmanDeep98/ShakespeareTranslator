Will you be gone?[To SICINIUS] You shall stay too: I would I had the powerTo say so to my husband.Are you mankind?Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxshipTo banish him that struck more blows for RomeThan thou hast spoken words?O blessed heavens!More noble blows than ever thou wise words;And for Rome’s good. I’ll tell thee what; yet go:Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my sonWere in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,His good sword in his hand.What then?What then!He’ld make an end of thy posterity.Bastards and all.Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!Come, come, peace.I would he had continued to his countryAs he began, and not unknit himselfThe noble knot he made.#LBSFORGOLD
