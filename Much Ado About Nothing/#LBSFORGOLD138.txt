Why either were you ignorant to see’t,Or, seeing it, of such childish friendlinessTo yield your voices?Could you not have told himAs you were lesson’d, when he had no power,But was a petty servant to the state,He was your enemy, ever spake againstYour liberties and the charters that you bearI’ the body of the weal; and now, arrivingA place of potency and sway o’ the state,If he should still malignantly remainFast foe to the plebeii, your voices mightBe curses to yourselves? You should have saidThat as his worthy deeds did claim no lessThan what he stood for, so his gracious natureWould think upon you for your voices andTranslate his malice towards you into love,Standing your friendly lord.Thus to have said,As you were fore-advised, had touch’d his spiritAnd tried his inclination; from him pluck’dEither his gracious promise, which you might,As cause had call’d you up, have held him toOr else it would have gall’d his surly nature,Which easily endures not articleTying him to aught; so putting him to rage,You should have ta’en the advantage of his cholerAnd pass’d him unelected.#LBSFORGOLD
