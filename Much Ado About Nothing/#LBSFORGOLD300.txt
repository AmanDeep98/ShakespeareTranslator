Thou art my warrior;I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?The noble sister of Publicola,The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicleThat’s curdied by the frost from purest snowAnd hangs on Dian’s temple: dear Valeria!This is a poor epitome of yours,Which by the interpretation of full timeMay show like all yourself.The god of soldiers,With the consent of supreme Jove, informThy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst proveTo shame unvulnerable, and stick i’ the warsLike a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,And saving those that eye thee!Your knee, sirrah.That’s my brave boy!Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,Are suitors to you.I beseech you, peace:Or, if you’ld ask, remember this before:The thing I have forsworn to grant may neverBe held by you denials. Do not bid meDismiss my soldiers, or capitulateAgain with Rome’s mechanics: tell me notWherein I seem unnatural: desire notTo ally my rages and revenges withYour colder reasons.#LBSFORGOLD
