My first son.Whither wilt thou go? Take good CominiusWith thee awhile: determine on some course,More than a wild exposture to each chanceThat starts i’ the way before thee.O the gods!I’ll follow thee a month, devise with theeWhere thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of usAnd we of thee: so if the time thrust forthA cause for thy repeal, we shall not sendO’er the vast world to seek a single man,And lose advantage, which doth ever coolI’ the absence of the needer.Fare ye well:Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too fullOf the wars’ surfeits, to go rove with oneThat’s yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, andMy friends of noble touch, when I am forth,Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.While I remain above the ground, you shallHear from me still, and never of me aughtBut what is like me formerly.#LBSFORGOLD
