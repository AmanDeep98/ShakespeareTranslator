He’ll never hear him.Not?I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eyeRed as ’twould burn Rome; and his injuryThe gaoler to his pity. I kneel’d before him;’Twas very faintly he said ‘Rise;’ dismiss’d meThus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,He sent in writing after me; what he would not,Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:So that all hope is vain.Unless his noble mother, and his wife;Who, as I hear, mean to solicit himFor mercy to his country. Therefore, let’s hence,And with our fair entreaties haste them on.#LBSFORGOLD
