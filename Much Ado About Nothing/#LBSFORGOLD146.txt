Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?He had, my lord; and that it was which causedOur swifter composition.So then the Volsces stand but as at first,Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.Upon’s again.They are worn, lord consul, so,That we shall hardly in our ages seeTheir banners wave again.Saw you Aufidius?On safe-guard he came to me; and did curseAgainst the Volsces, for they had so vilelyYielded the town: he is retired to Antium.Spoke he of me?He did, my lord.How? what?How often he had met you, sword to sword;That of all things upon the earth he hatedYour person most, that he would pawn his fortunesTo hopeless restitution, so he mightBe call’d your vanquisher.#LBSFORGOLD
