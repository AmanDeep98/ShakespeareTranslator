For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,The city is well stored.Hang ’em! They say!They’ll sit by the fire, and presume to knowWhat’s done i’ the Capitol; who’s like to rise,Who thrives and who declines; side factionsand give outConjectural marriages; making parties strongAnd feebling such as stand not in their likingBelow their cobbled shoes. They say there’sgrain enough!Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,And let me use my sword, I’ll make a quarryWith thousands of these quarter’d slaves, as highAs I could pick my lance.Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;For though abundantly they lack discretion,Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,What says the other troop?They are dissolved: hang ’em!They said they were an-hungry; sigh’d forth proverbs,That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent notCorn for the rich men only: with these shredsThey vented their complainings; which being answer’d,And a petition granted them, a strange one—To break the heart of generosity,And make bold power look pale—they threw their capsAs they would hang them on the horns o’ the moon,Shouting their emulation.#LBSFORGOLD
