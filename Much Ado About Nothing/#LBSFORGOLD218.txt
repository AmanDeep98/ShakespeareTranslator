I would he had.‘I would he had’! ’Twas you incensed the rabble:Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worthAs I can of those mysteries which heavenWill not have earth to know.Pray, let us go.Now, pray, sir, get you gone:You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:—As far as doth the Capitol exceedThe meanest house in Rome, so far my son—This lady’s husband here, this, do you see—Whom you have banish’d, does exceed you all.Well, well, we’ll leave you.Why stay we to be baitedWith one that wants her wits?Take my prayers with you.I would the gods had nothing else to doBut to confirm my curses! Could I meet ’emBut once a-day, it would unclog my heartOf what lies heavy to’t.You have told them home;And, by my troth, you have cause. You’ll sup with me?#LBSFORGOLD
