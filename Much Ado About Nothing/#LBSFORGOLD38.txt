Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you playthe idle husewife with me this afternoon.No, good madam; I will not out of doors.Not out of doors!She shall, she shall.Indeed, no, by your patience; I’ll not over thethreshold till my lord return from the wars.Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,you must go visit the good lady that lies in.I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her withmy prayers; but I cannot go thither.Why, I pray you?’Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, allthe yarn she spun in Ulysses’ absence did but fillIthaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambricwere sensible as your finger, that you might leavepricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.In truth, la, go with me; and I’ll tell youexcellent news of your husband.O, good madam, there can be none yet.Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news fromhim last night.#LBSFORGOLD
