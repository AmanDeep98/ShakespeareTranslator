Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beastWhere is your ancient courage? you were usedTo say extremity was the trier of spirits;That common chances common men could bear;That when the sea was calm all boats alikeShow’d mastership in floating; fortune’s blows,When most struck home, being gentle wounded, cravesA noble cunning: you were used to load meWith precepts that would make invincibleThe heart that conn’d them.O heavens! O heavens!Nay! prithee, woman,—Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,And occupations perish!What, what, what!I shall be loved when I am lack’d. Nay, mother.Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,If you had been the wife of Hercules,Six of his labours you’ld have done, and savedYour husband so much sweat. Cominius,Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:I’ll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,Thy tears are salter than a younger man’s,And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheldHeart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women’Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,As ’tis to laugh at ’em. My mother, you wot wellMy hazards still have been your solace: andBelieve’t not lightly—though I go alone,Like to a lonely dragon, that his fenMakes fear’d and talk’d of more than seen—your sonWill or exceed the common or be caughtWith cautelous baits and practise.#LBSFORGOLD
