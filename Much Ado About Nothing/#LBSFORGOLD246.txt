Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever toohard for him; I have heard him say so himself.He was too hard for him directly, to say the trothon’t: before Corioli he scotched him and notchedhim like a carbon ado.An he had been cannibally given, he might havebroiled and eaten him too.But, more of thy news?Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were sonand heir to Mars; set at upper end o’ the table; noquestion asked him by any of the senators, but theystand bald before him: our general himself makes amistress of him: sanctifies himself with’s hand andturns up the white o’ the eye to his discourse. Butthe bottom of the news is that our general is cut i’the middle and but one half of what he wasyesterday; for the other has half, by the entreatyand grant of the whole table. He’ll go, he says,and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: hewill mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.And he’s as like to do’t as any man I can imagine.Do’t! he will do’t; for, look you, sir, he has asmany friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as itwere, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, aswe term it, his friends whilst he’s in directitude.#LBSFORGOLD
