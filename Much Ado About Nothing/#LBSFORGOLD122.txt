Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.We may, sir, if we will.We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is apower that we have no power to do; for if he show ushis wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put ourtongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, ifhe tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell himour noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude ismonstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,were to make a monster of the multitude: of thewhich we being members, should bring ourselves to bemonstrous members.And to make us no better thought of, a little helpwill serve; for once we stood up about the corn, hehimself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.We have been called so of many; not that our headsare some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,but that our wits are so diversely coloured: andtruly I think if all our wits were to issue out ofone skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,and their consent of one direct way should be atonce to all the points oâ€™ the compass.#LBSFORGOLD
