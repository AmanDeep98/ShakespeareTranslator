Well, on to the market-place.Whoever gave that counsel, to give forthThe corn o’ the storehouse gratis, as ’twas usedSometime in Greece,—Well, well, no more of that.Though there the people had more absolute power,I say, they nourish’d disobedience, fedThe ruin of the state.Why, shall the people giveOne that speaks thus their voice?I’ll give my reasons,More worthier than their voices. They know the cornWas not our recompense, resting well assuredThat ne’er did service for’t: being press’d to the war,Even when the navel of the state was touch’d,They would not thread the gates. This kind of serviceDid not deserve corn gratis. Being i’ the warTheir mutinies and revolts, wherein they show’dMost valour, spoke not for them: the accusationWhich they have often made against the senate,All cause unborn, could never be the motiveOf our so frank donation. Well, what then?How shall this bisson multitude digestThe senate’s courtesy? Let deeds expressWhat’s like to be their words: ‘we did request it;We are the greater poll, and in true fearThey gave us our demands.’ Thus we debaseThe nature of our seats and make the rabbleCall our cares fears; which will in timeBreak ope the locks o’ the senate and bring inThe crows to peck the eagles.#LBSFORGOLD
