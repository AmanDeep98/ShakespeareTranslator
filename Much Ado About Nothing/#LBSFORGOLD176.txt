This is clean kam.Merely awry: when he did love his country,It honour’d him.The service of the footBeing once gangrened, is not then respectedFor what before it was.We’ll hear no more.Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:Lest his infection, being of catching nature,Spread further.One word more, one word.This tiger-footed rage, when it shall findThe harm of unscann’d swiftness, will too lateTie leaden pounds to’s heels. Proceed by process;Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,And sack great Rome with Romans.If it were so,—What do ye talk?Have we not had a taste of his obedience?Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.Consider this: he has been bred i’ the warsSince he could draw a sword, and is ill school’dIn bolted language; meal and bran togetherHe throws without distinction. Give me leave,I’ll go to him, and undertake to bring himWhere he shall answer, by a lawful form,In peace, to his utmost peril.#LBSFORGOLD
