I know you well, sir, and you knowme: your name, I think, is Adrian.It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.I am a Roman; and my services are,as you are, against ’em: know you me yet?Nicanor? no.The same, sir.You had more beard when I last saw you; but yourfavour is well approved by your tongue. What’s thenews in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,to find you out there: you have well saved me aday’s journey.There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; thepeople against the senators, patricians, and nobles.Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks notso: they are in a most warlike preparation, andhope to come upon them in the heat of their division.The main blaze of it is past, but a small thingwould make it flame again: for the nobles receiveso to heart the banishment of that worthyCoriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to takeall power from the people and to pluck from themtheir tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I cantell you, and is almost mature for the violentbreaking out.#LBSFORGOLD
