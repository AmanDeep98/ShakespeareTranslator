’Tis most like he will.It shall be to him then as our good wills,A sure destruction.So it must fall outTo him or our authorities. For an end,We must suggest the people in what hatredHe still hath held them; that to’s power he wouldHave made them mules, silenced their pleaders andDispropertied their freedoms, holding them,In human action and capacity,Of no more soul nor fitness for the worldThan camels in the war, who have their provandOnly for bearing burdens, and sore blowsFor sinking under them.This, as you say, suggestedAt some time when his soaring insolenceShall touch the people—which time shall not want,If he be put upon ’t; and that’s as easyAs to set dogs on sheep—will be his fireTo kindle their dry stubble; and their blazeShall darken him for ever.What’s the matter?#LBSFORGOLD
