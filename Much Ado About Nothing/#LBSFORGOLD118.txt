Sir, the peopleMust have their voices; neither will they bateOne jot of ceremony.Put them not to’t:Pray you, go fit you to the custom andTake to you, as your predecessors have,Your honour with your form.It is apartThat I shall blush in acting, and might wellBe taken from the people.(to Sicinius) Mark you that?To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,As if I had received them for the hireOf their breath only!Do not stand upon’t.We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,Our purpose to them: and to our noble consulWish we all joy and honour.To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!You see how he intends to use the people.May they perceive’s intent! He will require them,As if he did contemn what he requestedShould be in them to give.#LBSFORGOLD
