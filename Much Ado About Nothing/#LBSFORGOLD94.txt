Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!No more of this; it does offend my heart:Pray now, no more.Look, sir, your mother!O,You have, I know, petition’d all the godsFor my prosperity!Nay, my good soldier, up;My gentle Martius, worthy Caius, andBy deed-achieving honour newly named,—What is it?—Coriolanus must I call thee?—But O, thy wife!My gracious silence, hail!Wouldst thou have laugh’d had I come coffin’d home,That weep’st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,And mothers that lack sons.Now, the gods crown thee!And live you yet?(To VALERIA) O my sweet lady, pardon.I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:And welcome, general: and ye’re welcome all.#LBSFORGOLD
