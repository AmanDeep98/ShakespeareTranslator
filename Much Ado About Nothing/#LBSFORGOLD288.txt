Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he woulduse me with estimation.Come, my captain knows you not.I mean, thy general.My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lestI let forth your half-pint of blood; back,—that’sthe utmost of your having: back.Nay, but, fellow, fellow,—What’s the matter?Now, you companion, I’ll say an errand for you:You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shallperceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me frommy son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainmentwith him, if thou standest not i’ the state ofhanging, or of some death more long inspectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold nowpresently, and swoon for what’s to come upon thee.The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thyparticular prosperity, and love thee no worse thanthy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here’swater to quench it. I was hardly moved to come tothee; but being assured none but myself could movethee, I have been blown out of your gates withsighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thypetitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thywrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlethere,—this, who, like a block, hath denied myaccess to thee.#LBSFORGOLD
