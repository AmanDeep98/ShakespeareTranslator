But since he hathServed well for Rome,—What do you prate of service?I talk of that, that know it.You?Is this the promise that you made your mother?Know, I pray you,—I know no further:Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,Vagabond exile, raying, pent to lingerBut with a grain a day, I would not buyTheir mercy at the price of one fair word;Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,To have’t with saying ‘Good morrow.’For that he has,As much as in him lies, from time to timeEnvied against the people, seeking meansTo pluck away their power, as now at lastGiven hostile strokes, and that not in the presenceOf dreaded justice, but on the ministersThat do distribute it; in the name o’ the peopleAnd in the power of us the tribunes, we,Even from this instant, banish him our city,In peril of precipitationFrom off the rock Tarpeian never moreTo enter our Rome gates: i’ the people’s name,I say it shall be so.#LBSFORGOLD
