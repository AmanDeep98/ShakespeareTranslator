How lies their battle? know you on which sideThey have placed their men of trust?As I guess, Martius,Their bands i’ the vaward are the Antiates,Of their best trust; o’er them Aufidius,Their very heart of hope.I do beseech you,By all the battles wherein we have fought,By the blood we have shed together, by the vowsWe have made to endure friends, that you directlySet me against Aufidius and his Antiates;And that you not delay the present, but,Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,We prove this very hour.Though I could wishYou were conducted to a gentle bathAnd balms applied to, you, yet dare I neverDeny your asking: take your choice of thoseThat best can aid your action.Those are theyThat most are willing. If any such be here—As it were sin to doubt—that love this paintingWherein you see me smear’d; if any fearLesser his person than an ill report;If any think brave death outweighs bad lifeAnd that his country’s dearer than himself;Let him alone, or so many so minded,Wave thus, to express his disposition,And follow Martius.#LBSFORGOLD
