Come, come, they are almost here. How many standfor consulships?Three, they say: but ’tis thought of every oneCoriolanus will carry it.That’s a brave fellow; but he’s vengeance proud, andloves not the common people.Faith, there had been many great men that haveflattered the people, who ne’er loved them; and therebe many that they have loved, they know notwherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, forCoriolanus neither to care whether they love or hatehim manifests the true knowledge he has in theirdisposition; and out of his noble carelessness letsthem plainly see’t.If he did not care whether he had their love or no,he waved indifferently ’twixt doing them neithergood nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greaterdevotion than can render it him; and leavesnothing undone that may fully discover him theiropposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice anddispleasure of the people is as bad as that which hedislikes, to flatter them for their love.#LBSFORGOLD
