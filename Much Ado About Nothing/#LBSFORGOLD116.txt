Worthy man!He cannot but with measure fit the honoursWhich we devise him.Our spoils he kick’d at,And look’d upon things precious as they wereThe common muck of the world: he covets lessThan misery itself would give; rewardsHis deeds with doing them, and is contentTo spend the time to end it.He’s right noble:Let him be call’d for.Call Coriolanus.He doth appear.The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleasedTo make thee consul.I do owe them stillMy life and services.It then remainsThat you do speak to the people.I do beseech you,Let me o’erleap that custom, for I cannotPut on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,For my wounds’ sake, to give their suffrage: please youThat I may pass this doing.#LBSFORGOLD
