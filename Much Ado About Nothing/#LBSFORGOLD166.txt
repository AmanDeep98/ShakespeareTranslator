Aediles, seize him!Yield, Martius, yield!Hear me one word;Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.Peace, peace![To BRUTUS] Be that you seem, truly yourcountry’s friend,And temperately proceed to what you wouldThus violently redress.Sir, those cold ways,That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonousWhere the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,And bear him to the rock.No, I’ll die here.There’s some among you have beheld me fighting:Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.Lay hands upon him.Help Martius, help,You that be noble; help him, young and old!Down with him, down with him!#LBSFORGOLD
