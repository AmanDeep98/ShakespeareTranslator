I neither care for the world nor your general: forsuch things as you, I can scarce think there’s any,ye’re so slight. He that hath a will to die byhimself fears it not from another: let your generaldo his worst. For you, be that you are, long; andyour misery increase with your age! I say to you,as I was said to, Away!A noble fellow, I warrant him.The worthy fellow is our general: he’s the rock, theoak not to be wind-shaken.#LBSFORGOLD
