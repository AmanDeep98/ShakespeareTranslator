Sir, I beseech you, think you he’ll carry Rome?All places yield to him ere he sits down;And the nobility of Rome are his:The senators and patricians love him too:The tribunes are no soldiers; and their peopleWill be as rash in the repeal, as hastyTo expel him thence. I think he’ll be to RomeAs is the osprey to the fish, who takes itBy sovereignty of nature. First he wasA noble servant to them; but he could notCarry his honours even: whether ’twas pride,Which out of daily fortune ever taintsThe happy man; whether defect of judgment,To fail in the disposing of those chancesWhich he was lord of; or whether nature,Not to be other than one thing, not movingFrom the casque to the cushion, but commanding peaceEven with the same austerity and garbAs he controll’d the war; but one of these—As he hath spices of them all, not all,For I dare so far free him—made him fear’d,So hated, and so banish’d: but he has a merit,To choke it in the utterance. So our virtuesLie in the interpretation of the time:And power, unto itself most commendable,Hath not a tomb so evident as a chairTo extol what it hath done.One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.Come, let’s away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,Thou art poor’st of all; then shortly art thou mine.#LBSFORGOLD#LBSFORGOLD
