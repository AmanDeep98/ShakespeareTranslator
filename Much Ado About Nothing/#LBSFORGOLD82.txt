The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.Good or bad?Not according to the prayer of the people, for theylove not Martius.Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.Pray you, who does the wolf love?The lamb.Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would thenoble Martius.He’s a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.He’s a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You twoare old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.Well, sir.In what enormity is Martius poor in, that you twohave not in abundance?He’s poor in no one fault, but stored with all.Especially in pride.And topping all others in boasting.This is strange now: do you two know how you arecensured here in the city, I mean of us o’ theright-hand file? do you?#LBSFORGOLD
