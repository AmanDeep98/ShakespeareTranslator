My ladies both, good day to you.Sweet madam.I am glad to see your ladyship.How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.(to Volumnia) What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in goodfaith. (to Virgilia) How does your little son?I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, thanlook upon his school-master.O’ my word, the father’s son: I’ll swear, ’tis avery pretty boy.

I saw him run after a gildedbutterfly: and when he caught it, he let it goagain; and after it again; and over and over hecomes, and again; catched it again; or whether hisfall enraged him, or how ’twas, he did so set histeeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammockedit!One on ’s father’s moods.Indeed, la, ’tis a noble child.A crack, madam.#LBSFORGOLD
