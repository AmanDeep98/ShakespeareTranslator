Nay, let them follow:The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thitherTo gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.Was ever man so proud as is this Martius?He has no equal.When we were chosen tribunes for the people,—Mark’d you his lip and eyes?Nay. [B]ut his taunts.Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.Be-mock the modest moon.The present wars devour him: he is grownToo proud to be so valiant.Such a nature,Tickled with good success, disdains the shadowWhich he treads on at noon: but I do wonderHis insolence can brook to be commandedUnder Cominius.Fame, at the which he aims,In whom already he’s well graced, can notBetter be held nor more attain’d than byA place below the first: for what miscarriesShall be the general’s fault, though he performTo the utmost of a man, and giddy censureWill then cry out of Martius ‘O if heHad borne the business!’#LBSFORGOLD
