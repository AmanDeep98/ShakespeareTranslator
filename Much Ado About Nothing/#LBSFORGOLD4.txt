Against him first: he’s a very dog to the commonalty.Consider you what services he has done for his country?Very well; and could be content to give him goodreport fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.Nay, but speak not maliciously.I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he didit to that end: though soft-conscienced men can becontent to say it was for his country he did it toplease his mother and to be partly proud; which heis, even till the altitude of his virtue.What he cannot help in his nature, you account avice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.What shouts are these? The other side o’ the cityis risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!Come, come.Soft! who comes here?Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always lovedthe people.He’s one honest enough: would all the rest were so!#LBSFORGOLD
