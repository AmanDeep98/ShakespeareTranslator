O mother, mother!What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,The gods look down, and this unnatural sceneThey laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!You have won a happy victory to Rome;But, for your son,—believe it, O, believe it,Most dangerously you have with him prevail’d,If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,I’ll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,Were you in my stead, would you have heardA mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?I was moved withal.I dare be sworn you were:And, sir, it is no little thing to makeMine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,What peace you’ll make, advise me: for my part,I’ll not to Rome, I’ll back with you; and pray you,Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife![Aside] I am glad thou hast set thy mercy andthy honourAt difference in thee: out of that I’ll workMyself a former fortune.#LBSFORGOLD
