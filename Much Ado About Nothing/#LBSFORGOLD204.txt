It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:He’s banish’d, and it shall be so.Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,—He’s sentenced; no more hearing.Let me speak:I have been consul, and can show for RomeHer enemies’ marks upon me. I do loveMy country’s good with a respect more tender,More holy and profound, than mine own life,My dear wife’s estimate, her womb’s increase,And treasure of my loins; then if I wouldSpeak that,—We know your drift: speak what?There’s no more to be said, but he is banish’d,As enemy to the people and his country:It shall be so.It shall be so, it shall be so.You common cry of curs! whose breath I hateAs reek o’ the rotten fens, whose loves I prizeAs the dead carcasses of unburied menThat do corrupt my air, I banish you;And here remain with your uncertainty!Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,Fan you into despair! Have the power stillTo banish your defenders; till at lengthYour ignorance, which finds not till it feels,Making not reservation of yourselves,Still your own foes, deliver you as mostAbated captives to some nationThat won you without blows! Despising,For you, the city, thus I turn my back:There is a world elsewhere.#LBSFORGOLD
