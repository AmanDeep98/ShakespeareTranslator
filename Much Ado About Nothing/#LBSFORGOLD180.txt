Let them puff all about mine ears, present meDeath on the wheel or at wild horsesâ€™ heels,Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,That the precipitation might down stretchBelow the beam of sight, yet will I stillBe thus to them.You do the nobler.I muse my motherDoes not approve me further, who was wontTo call them woollen vassals, things createdTo buy and sell with groats, to show bare headsIn congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,When one but of my ordinance stood upTo speak of peace or war.I talk of you:Why did you wish me milder? would you have meFalse to my nature? Rather say I playThe man I am.O, sir, sir, sir,I would have had you put your power well on,Before you had worn it out.#LBSFORGOLD
