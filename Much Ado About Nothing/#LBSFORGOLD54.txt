Breathe you, my friends: well fought;we are come offLike Romans, neither foolish in our stands,Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,By interims and conveying gusts we have heardThe charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!Lead their successes as we wish our own,That both our powers, with smilingfronts encountering,May give you thankful sacrifice.Thy news?The citizens of Corioli have issued,And given to Lartius and to Martius battle:I saw our party to their trenches driven,And then I came away.Though thou speak’st truth,Methinks thou speak’st not well.How long is’t since?Above an hour, my lord.#LBSFORGOLD
