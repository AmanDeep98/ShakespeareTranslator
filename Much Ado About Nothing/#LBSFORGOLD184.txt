What must I do?Return to the tribunes.Well, what then? what then?Repent what you have spoke.For them! I cannot do it to the gods;Must I then do’t to them?You are too absolute;Though therein you can never be too noble,But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,Honour and policy, like unsever’d friends,I’ the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,In peace what each of them by the other lose,That they combine not there.Tush, tush!A good demand.If it be honour in your wars to seemThe same you are not, which, for your best ends,You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,That it shall hold companionship in peaceWith honour, as in war, since that to bothIt stands in like request?Why force you this?Because that now it lies you on to speakTo the people; not by your own instruction,Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,But with such words that are but rooted inYour tongue, though but bastards and syllablesOf no allowance to your bosom’s truth.Now, this no more dishonours you at allThan to take in a town with gentle words,Which else would put you to your fortune andThe hazard of much blood.I would dissemble with my nature whereMy fortunes and my friends at stake requiredI should do so in honour: I am in this,Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;And you will rather show our general loutsHow you can frown than spend a fawn upon ’em,For the inheritance of their loves and safeguardOf what that want might ruin.#LBSFORGOLD
