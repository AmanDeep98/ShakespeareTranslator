We will before the walls of Rome tomorrowSet down our host. My partner in this action,You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainlyI have borne this business.Only their endsYou have respected; stopp’d your ears againstThe general suit of Rome; never admittedA private whisper, no, not with such friendsThat thought them sure of you.This last old man,Whom with a crack’d heart I have sent to Rome,Loved me above the measure of a father;Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refugeWas to send him; for whose old love I have,Though I show’d sourly to him, once more offer’dThe first conditions, which they did refuseAnd cannot now accept; to grace him onlyThat thought he could do more, a very littleI have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafterWill I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?#LBSFORGOLD
