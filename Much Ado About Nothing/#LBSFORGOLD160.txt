Has said enough.Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answerAs traitors do.Thou wretch, despite o’erwhelm thee!What should the people do with these bald tribunes?On whom depending, their obedience failsTo the greater bench: in a rebellion,When what’s not meet, but what must be, was law,Then were they chosen: in a better hour,Let what is meet be said it must be meet,And throw their power i’ the dust.Manifest treason!This a consul? no.The aediles, ho!Let him be apprehended.Go, call the people:in whose name myselfAttach thee as a traitorous innovator,A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,And follow to thine answer.
