He loves your peopleBut tie him not to be their bedfellow.Worthy Cominius, speak.Nay, keep your place.Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hearWhat you have nobly done.Your horror’s pardon:I had rather have my wounds to heal againThan hear say how I got them.Sir, I hopeMy words disbench’d you not.No, sir: yet oft,When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.You soothed not, therefore hurt not: butyour people,I love them as they weigh.Pray now, sit down.I had rather have one scratch my head i’ the sunWhen the alarum were struck than idly sitTo hear my nothings monster’d.Masters of the people,Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter—That’s thousand to one good one—when you now seeHe had rather venture all his limbs for honourThan one on’s ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.#LBSFORGOLD
