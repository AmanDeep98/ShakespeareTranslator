Away! get you away.Now thou’rt troublesome.Are you so brave? I’ll have you talked with anon.What fellow’s this?A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get himout of the house: prithee, call my master to him.What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoidthe house.Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.What are you?A gentleman.A marvellous poor one.True, so I am.Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some otherstation; here’s no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what astrange guest he has here.And I shall.#LBSFORGOLD
