May these same instruments, which you profane,Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shallI’ the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities beMade all of false-faced soothing!When steel grows soft as the parasite’s silk,Let him be made a coverture for the wars!No more, I say! For that I have not wash’dMy nose that bled, or foil’d some debile wretch.—Which, without note, here’s many else have done,—You shout me forthIn acclamations hyperbolical;As if I loved my little should be dietedIn praises sauced with lies.Too modest are you;More cruel to your good report than gratefulTo us that give you truly: by your patience,If ’gainst yourself you be incensed, we’ll put you,Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,As to us, to all the world, that Caius MartiusWears this war’s garland: in token of the which,My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,With all his trim belonging; and from this time,For what he did before Corioli, call him,With all the applause and clamour of the host,CAIUS MARTIUS CORIOLANUS! BearThe addition nobly ever!#LBSFORGOLD
