Then our office may,During his power, go sleep.He cannot temperately transport his honoursFrom where he should begin and end, but willLose those he hath won.In that there’s comfort.Doubt notThe commoners, for whom we stand, but theyUpon their ancient malice will forgetWith the least cause these his new honours, whichThat he will give them make I as little questionAs he is proud to do’t.I heard him swear,Were he to stand for consul, never would heAppear i’ the market-place nor on him putThe napless vesture of humility;Nor showing, as the manner is, his woundsTo the people, beg their stinking breaths.’Tis right.It was his word: O, he would miss it ratherThan carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,And the desire of the nobles.I wish no betterThan have him hold that purpose and to put itIn execution.#LBSFORGOLD
