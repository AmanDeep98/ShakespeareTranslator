Caius Martius Coriolanus!I will go wash;And when my face is fair, you shall perceiveWhether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.I mean to stride your steed, and at all timesTo undercrest your good additionTo the fairness of my power.So, to our tent;Where, ere we do repose us, we will writeTo Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,Must to Corioli back: send us to RomeThe best, with whom we may articulate,For their own good and ours.I shall, my lord.The gods begin to mock me. I, that nowRefused most princely gifts, am bound to begOf my lord general.Take’t; ’tis yours. What is’t?I sometime lay here in CorioliAt a poor man’s house; he used me kindly:He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;But then Aufidius was with in my view,And wrath o’erwhelm’d my pity: I request youTo give my poor host freedom.#LBSFORGOLD
