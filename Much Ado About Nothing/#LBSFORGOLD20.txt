You have fought together.Were half to half the world by the ears and he.Upon my party, I’ld revolt to makeOnly my wars with him: he is a lionThat I am proud to hunt.Then, worthy Martius,Attend upon Cominius to these wars.It is your former promise.Sir, it is;And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thouShalt see me once more strike at Tullus’ face.What, art thou stiff? stand’st out?No, Caius Martius;I’ll lean upon one crutch and fight with t’other,Ere stay behind this business.O, true-bred!Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,Our greatest friends attend us.[To COMINIUS] Lead you on.Right worthy you priority.Noble Martius![To the Citizens] Hence to your homes; be gone!#LBSFORGOLD
