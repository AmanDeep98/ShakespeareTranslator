Now the fair goddess, Fortune,Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charmsMisguide thy opposers’ swords! Bold gentleman,Prosperity be thy page!Thy friend no lessThan those she placeth highest! So, farewell.Thou worthiest Martius!Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;Call thither all the officers o’ the town,Where they shall know our mind: away!#LBSFORGOLD
