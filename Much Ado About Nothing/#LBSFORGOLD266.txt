Here come the clusters.And is Aufidius with him? You are theyThat made the air unwholesome, when you castYour stinking greasy caps in hooting atCoriolanus’ exile. Now he’s coming;And not a hair upon a soldier’s headWhich will not prove a whip: as many coxcombsAs you threw caps up will he tumble down,And pay you for your voices. ’Tis no matter;if he could burn us all into one coal,We have deserved it.Faith, we hear fearful news.For mine own part,When I said, banish him, I said ’twas pity.And so did I.And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did verymany of us: that we did, we did for the best; andthough we willingly consented to his banishment, yetit was against our will.Ye are goodly things, you voices!You have madeGood work, you and your cry! Shall’s to the Capitol?#LBSFORGOLD
