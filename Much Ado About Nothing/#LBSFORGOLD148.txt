At Antium lives he?At Antium.I wish I had a cause to seek him there,To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,The tongues o’ the common mouth: I do despise them;For they do prank them in authority,Against all noble sufferance.Pass no further.Ha! what is that?It will be dangerous to go on: no further.What makes this change?The matter?Hath he not pass’d the noble and the common?Cominius, no.Have I had children’s voices?Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.The people are incensed against him.Stop,Or all will fall in broil.Are these your herd?Must these have voices, that can yield them nowAnd straight disclaim their tongues? What areyour offices?You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?Have you not set them on?#LBSFORGOLD
