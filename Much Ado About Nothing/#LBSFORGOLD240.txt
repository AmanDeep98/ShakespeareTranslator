O Martius, Martius!Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heartA root of ancient envy. If JupiterShould from yond cloud speak divine things,And say ‘’Tis true,’ I’ld not believe them moreThan thee, all noble Martius. Let me twineMine arms about that body, where againstMy grained ash an hundred times hath brokeAnd scarr’d the moon with splinters: here I clipThe anvil of my sword, and do contestAs hotly and as nobly with thy loveAs ever in ambitious strength I didContend against thy valour. Know thou first,I loved the maid I married; never manSigh’d truer breath; but that I see thee here,Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heartThan when I first my wedded mistress sawBestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,We have a power on foot; and I had purposeOnce more to hew thy target from thy brawn,Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me outTwelve several times, and I have nightly sinceDreamt of encounters ’twixt thyself and me;We have been down together in my sleep,Unbuckling helms, fisting each other’s throat,And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Martius,Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but thatThou art thence banish’d, we would muster allFrom twelve to seventy, and pouring warInto the bowels of ungrateful Rome,Like a bold flood o’er-bear. O, come, go in,And take our friendly senators by the hands;Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,Who am prepared against your territories,
