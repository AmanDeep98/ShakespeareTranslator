Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy hismother shall bring from him: there is no more mercyin him than there is milk in a male tiger; thatshall our poor city find: and all this is long ofyou.The gods be good unto us!No, in such a case the gods will not be good untous. When we banished him, we respected not them;and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.Sir, if you’ld save your life, fly to your house:The plebeians have got your fellow-tribuneAnd hale him up and down, all swearing, ifThe Roman ladies bring not comfort home,They’ll give him death by inches.What’s the news?Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail’d,The Volscians are dislodged, and Martius gone:A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.Friend,Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?#LBSFORGOLD
