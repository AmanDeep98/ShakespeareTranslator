What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.O poor Orlando! Thou art overthrown.Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.Good sir, I do in friendship counsel youTo leave this place. Albeit you have deservedHigh commendation, true applause, and love,Yet such is now the duke’s conditionThat he misconsters all that you have done.The duke is humorous. What he is indeedMore suits you to conceive than I to speak of.I thank you, sir, and pray you tell me this:Which of the two was daughter of the dukeThat here was at the wrestling?Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners,But yet indeed the smaller is his daughterThe other is daughter to the banished duke,And here detained by her usurping uncleTo keep his daughter company, whose lovesAre dearer than the natural bond of sisters.But I can tell you that of late this dukeHath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,Grounded upon no other argumentBut that the people praise her for her virtuesAnd pity her for her good father’s sake;And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the ladyWill suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well.Hereafter, in a better world than this,I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.#LBSFORGOLDWhat is this passion that ties up my tongue? I can’t speak to her, even though she asked me to. Oh, poor Orlando, you’ve been overthrown! Either Charles or some prettier thing has mastered you.Good sir, as a friend, I advise you to leave this place. Although you deserve praise, applause, and love, right now the duke misconstrues everything you’ve done. The duke is temperamental. I’m sure you can imagine what I mean without my having to spell it out.Thank you, sir. Now please tell me this: which of the two ladies who were at the wrestling match is the duke’s daughter?Neither one is his daughter, to judge from their good manners. But really, the smaller one is his daughter. The other is the daughter of the banished duke. Duke Frederick keeps her for his daughter’s sake; the love between the two of them is stronger than the bond between sisters. But I will tell you that lately the duke has been displeased with his niece, and for no other reason than that people praise her virtues and pity her for her father’s sake. I swear, one day the duke’s malice toward Rosalind will suddenly erupt. Goodbye, sir. Later, in a better world than this, I’d love to get to know you.
