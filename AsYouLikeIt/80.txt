More at your request than to please myself.Well then, if ever I thank any man, I’ll thank you. But that
they call “compliment” is like th' encounter of two dog-
apes. And when a man thanks me heartily, methinks I have
given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks.
Come, sing. And you that will not, hold your tongues.
Well, I’ll end the song.—Sirs, cover the while; the duke will
drink under this tree.—He hath been all this day to look
you.
And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is too
disputable for my company. I think of as many matters as
he, but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them.
Come, warble, come.

(singing)

Who doth ambition shun

And loves to live i' th' sun,

Seeking the food he eats

And pleased with what he gets,

Come hither, come hither, come hither.

Here shall he see

No enemy

But winter and rough weather.
I’ll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in
despite of my invention.
#LBSFORGOLDOkay, but only because you want me to.Well then, if I’ve ever thanked a man, I’ll thank you now. But two men complimenting each other is like two baboons getting together. Whenever a man compliments me, I feel like he’s a beggar and I just gave him a penny—an embarrassing exchange. Come on, sing—and those of you who won’t sing, shut up.Well, I’ll finish the song I started.—Meanwhile, sirs, set the table. The duke will drink under this tree.—He’s been looking for you all day, you know.And I’ve been avoiding him all day. He’s too argumentative for me. I think of as many things as he does, but I just thank heaven and don’t show off about it. Come, warble for me.
(singing)

Whoever shuns ambition

And loves to live in the sun,

Hunting the food he eats

Pleased with what he finds,

Come here, come here, come here.

Here he will findNo enemy

But winter and rough weather.
I wrote a verse to this tune, though it’s not very imaginative. I’ll give it you.
