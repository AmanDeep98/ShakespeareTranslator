Peace. Here comes my sister reading. Stand aside.
(as Aliena, reads) Why should this a desert be?For it is unpeopled? No.Tongues I’ll hang on every treeThat shall civil sayings show.Some how brief the life of manRuns his erring pilgrimage,That the stretching of a spanBuckles in his sum of age;Some of violated vows'Twixt the souls of friend and friend.But upon the fairest boughs,Or at every sentence end,Will I “Rosalinda” write,Teaching all that read to knowThe quintessence of every spriteHeaven would in little show.Therefore heaven nature chargedThat one body should be filledWith all graces wide-enlarged.Nature presently distilledHelen’s cheek, but not her heart,Cleopatra’s majesty,Atalanta’s better part,Sad Lucretia’s modesty.#LBSFORGOLDAll right, you’ve had your say, but we’ll let the forest judge whether or not you spoke wisely.Quiet! Here comes my cousin, reading something; step aside.

No,I’ll hang these poems on every tree,And they will voice the thoughts of a city.Some will be about how man’s brief life is spent in wandering,his entire life containedin the width of an open hand.Some poems will be about betrayalsCommitted by friends.But on the prettiest branchesOr at the end of every sentence I’ll write “Rosalinda,”Teaching everyone who can readthat the essence of every spiritIs contained in this one woman.Heaven commanded NatureTo fill her one bodyWith all the graces that women contain.Nature tookHelen’s beautifulHelen, Cleopatra, Atalanta, and Lucretia are beautiful women featured in Greek and Roman mythology.beautiful face, but not her fickle heart;Cleopatra’s majesty,The best of Atalanta,And unhappy Lucretia’s modesty.
