Good my complexion, dost thou think though I am
caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my
disposition? One inch of delay more is a South Sea of
discovery. I prithee, tell me who is it quickly, and speak
apace. I would thou couldst stammer, that thou might’st
pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes
out of a narrow-mouthed bottle—either too much at once,
or none at all. I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth, that
I may drink thy tidings.
So you may put a man in your belly.Is he of God’s making? What manner of man? Is his head
worth a hat or his chin worth a beard?
Nay, he hath but a little beard.Why, God will send more, if the man will be thankful. Let
me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the
knowledge of his chin.
It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler’s heels and
your heart both in an instant.
Nay, but the devil take mocking. Speak sad brow and true
maid.
I' faith, coz, ’tis he.Orlando?Orlando.#LBSFORGOLDGood grief, do you think that just because I’m dressed like a man, I have a man’s patience? Every second you delay is as long and dull as a journey to South Seas. I’m begging you, tell me who it is quickly, and speak fast. I wish you could just stammer this hidden man out of your mouth like wine out of a narrow-necked bottle: either too much at once or none at all. I’m begging you, take the cork out of your mouth so I can drink the news.So you want to put a man in your belly.Did God make him? I mean, what sort of man is he? Is he enough of a man to wear a hat and grow a beard ?No, he has only a little beard.Well, eventually God will send him some more hair, if he thanks Him. I’ll wait till his beard grows in, if you’ll just hurry up and tell me what chin that beard is on.It’s Orlando, who triumphed over both the wrestler and you in the same instant.Damn you for mocking me. Speak seriously and honestly.Really, cousin, it’s him.Orlando?Orlando.
