With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no,

These pretty country folks would lie

In springtime, the only pretty ring time,

When birds do sing, Hey ding a ding, ding.

Sweet lovers love the spring.

This carol they began that hour,

With a hey, and a ho, and a hey hey-nonny-no,

How that a life was but a flower

In springtime, the only pretty ring time,

When birds do sing, Hey ding a ding, ding.

Sweet lovers love the spring.

And therefore take the present time,

With a hey, and a ho, and a hey hey-nonny-no,

For love is crownèd with the prime

In springtime, the only pretty ring time,

When birds do sing, Hey ding a ding, ding.

Sweet lovers love the spring.
Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great matter
in the ditty, yet the note was  very untunable.
You are deceived, sir. We kept time. We lost not our time.By my troth, yes. I count it but time lost to hear such a
foolish song. God be wi' you, and God mend your voices.—
Come, Audrey.

With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no

The pretty country folk would lie

In the springtime, the only proper wedding-time,

The time when birds sing, Hey ding-a-ding-ding.

Sweet lovers love the spring.

They wrote this song at that time,

With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no,

About how life was as short-lived as a flower

In the springtime, the only proper wedding time,

The time when birds sing, hey ding-a-ding-ding.

Sweet lovers love the spring.

So seize the present time,

With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no,

For love is all perfection

In the springtime, the only proper wedding time,

The time when birds sing, Hey ding-a-ding-ding.

Sweet lovers love the spring.
Really, young men, though it wasn’t a very hard song to get right, the music was still all out of tune.No, sir, you’re wrong; we kept the song’sIn other words, they kept the rhythm and didn’t speed up. However, Touchstone was complaining not about the rhythm but about the melody.song’s time, we didn’t lose any.Oh, yes you did—I lost time listening to your foolish song. God be with you, and I hope He fixes your voices! Come on, Audrey.
