That is the way to make her scorn you still.O Corin, that thou knew’st how I do love her!I partly guess, for I have loved ere now.No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,Though in thy youth thou wast as true a loverAs ever sighed upon a midnight pillow.But if thy love were ever like to mine—As sure I think did never man love so—How many actions most ridiculousHast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?Into a thousand that I have forgotten.Oh, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily.If thou rememb’rest not the slightest follyThat ever love did make thee run into,Thou hast not loved.Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress’s praise,Thou hast not loved.Or if thou hast not broke from companyAbruptly, as my passion now makes me,Thou hast not loved.O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!Alas, poor shepherd, searching of thy wound,I have by hard adventure found mine own.#LBSFORGOLDWhat you’re doing is the way to make her scorn you continually.Oh, Corin, I wish you could understand how much I love her!I’m sure I can guess. I have been in love too, you know.No Corin, since you’re old, you cannot guess—even if you were as dedicated a lover in your youth as there ever was, sighing and mooning all night long. If your love was anything like mine—and I’m sure that no man has loved as I love now—exactly how many ridiculous actions did your fantasizing lead you to?Oh, a thousand of them, all of which I’ve forgotten.Oh, then you never loved as wholeheartedly as me. If you can’t remember the stupidest little thing love made you do, you haven’t loved. Or if you haven’t sat as I do now, boring your listener with all your lover’s virtues, then you haven’t loved. Or if you haven’t broken away from human company, as my feelings now lead me to do, you haven’t loved. O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!Oh, poor shepherd! Listening to you speak of your wounded heart reminds me of my own pain.
