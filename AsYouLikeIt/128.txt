By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.He is drowned in the brook. Look but in, and you shall see
him.
There I shall see mine own figure.Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.I’ll tarry no longer with you. Farewell, good Signior Love.I am glad of your departure. Adieu, good MonsieurMelancholy.
(aside to  CELIA)  I will speak to him like a saucy lackey, and
under that habit play the knave with him.—Do you hear,
forester?
Very well. What would you?
(as Ganymede)  I pray you, what is ’t o'clock?You should ask me what time o' day. There’s no clock in the
forest.
Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing every
minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot
of time as well as a clock.
#LBSFORGOLDWell, I was  looking for a fool when I found you, so I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised.He’s drowned in the brook: look in, and you’ll see him.There I’ll see only myself.Which is either a fool or a nothing.I’m not going to waste any more time with you. Goodbye, good Mr. Love.I’m glad to see you go. Adieu, good Mr. Depression.
(speaking so that only  CELIA can hear)  I’m going to talk to him like I’m an insolent boy, so I can play a trick on him.—Can you hear me, forester?Very well. What do you want?
(as Ganymede)  Please, what’s the hour?You should ask me what time of day it is, instead. There’s no clock here in the forest.Then there must be no lovers in the forest, either, because they’re as good as a clock, marking the lazy foot of time with a sigh every minute and a groan every hour.
