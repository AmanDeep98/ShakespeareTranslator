(as Aliena)
West of this place, down in the neighbor bottom,The rank of osiers by the murmuring streamLeft on your right hand brings you to the place.But at this hour the house doth keep itself.There’s none within.If that an eye may profit by a tongue,Then should I know you by description.Such garments, and such years. “The boy is fair,Of female favor, and bestows himselfLike a ripe sister; the woman lowAnd browner than her brother.” Are not youThe owner of the house I did inquire for?It is no boast, being asked, to say we are.Orlando doth commend him to you both,And to that youth he calls his RosalindHe sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
(as Ganymede) I am. What must we understand by this?Some of my shame, if you will know of meWhat man I am, and how, and why, and whereThis handkercher was stained.I pray you, tell it.#LBSFORGOLDWest of here, in the valley next to us. Passing by on your right, there is a row of willows. Follow them straight to the cottage. But right now, the house is keeping to itself— there’s no one home.I think I recognize you from a description I was given of your clothing and age: “The boy is pretty and feminine, and carries himself like a blooming young woman. The woman is short, with a darker complexion than her brother.” Aren’t you the owners of the house I was just asking about?Since you asked, I suppose it’s not bragging to say that we are.Orlando sends his regards to you both, and he sends this bloody handkerchief to the boy he calls “his Rosalind.” Is that you?It is. What does this mean?It’s a story that involves some shame on my part. It’s about who I am, and how, why, and where this handkerchief was stained.Please, tell us.
