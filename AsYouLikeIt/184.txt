No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of
thought, conceived of spleen, and born of madness, that
blind rascally boy that abuses everyone’s eyes because his
own are out, let him be judge how deep I am in love. I’ll tell
thee, Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I’ll go
find a shadow and sigh till he come.
And I’ll sleep.#LBSFORGOLDCupid—that blind bastard son of Venus, conceived from a thought and anger, born from insanity, that blind, naughty boy who makes everyone else go blind just because he can’t see himself—let Cupid judge how deep my love runs. I’m telling you, Aliena, I can’t stand being apart from Orlando. I’m going to find some shade and sigh until he returns.And I’m going to sleep.
