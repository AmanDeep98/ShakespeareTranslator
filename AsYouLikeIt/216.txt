I care not if I have. It is my studyTo seem despiteful and ungentle to you.You are there followed by a faithful shepherd.Look upon him, love him; he worships you.Good shepherd, tell this youth what ’tis to love.It is to be all made of sighs and tears,And so am I for Phoebe.And I for Ganymede.And I for Rosalind.And I for no woman.It is to be all made of faith and service,And so am I for Phoebe.And I for Ganymede.And I for Rosalind.And I for no woman.It is to be all made of fantasy,All made of passion and all made of wishes,All adoration, duty, and observance,All humbleness, all patience and impatience,All purity, all trial, all observance,And so am I for Phoebe.And so am I for Ganymede.And so am I for Rosalind.#LBSFORGOLDI don’t care. I’m being contemptuous and cruel toward you on purpose. A faithful shepherd worships you. Why don’t you pay attention to him? Why don’t you love him? He adores you.Silvius, tell this youth what it means to be in love.It means being full of sighs and tears, like I am for Phoebe.And like I am for Ganymede.And like I am for Rosalind.And like I am for no woman.It means being faithful and ready to serve, just like I am for Phoebe.And like I am for Ganymede.And like I am for Rosalind.And like I am for no woman.It means being filled with fantasy; with passion and wishes; with adoration, loyalty, and devotion. It means being humble, being patient, being impatient, being pure, being put-upon, being obedient. Just as I am for Phoebe.And I for Ganymede.And I for Rosalind.
