Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday humor,
and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now,
an I were your very, very Rosalind?
I would kiss before I spoke.Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were
graveled for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss.
Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for
lovers lacking—God warn us—matter, the cleanliest shift
is to kiss.
How if the kiss be denied?Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?Marry, that should you if I were your mistress, or I should
think my honesty ranker than my wit.
What, of my suit?Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit. Am not I
your Rosalind?
#LBSFORGOLDCome on, woo me, woo me. I’m in a good mood now and likely to give you what you want. What would you say to me now if I really were your precious little Rosalind?I’d kiss you before I spoke.No, it would be better to speak first and kiss only after you’ve run out of things to say. When good orators finish talking, they spit; when lovers do (God help us if they ever do), they kiss.What if she won’t kiss me?Then she’s making you beg, and that gives you a whole new set of things to talk about.Who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves?Indeed, you would be out if I were your mistress—if my chastity is worth as much as my wit.Would I be out of my suit“Out of my suit” here means he’d have to end his courtship of Rosalind (suit is used in the legal sense). Rosalind takes him to mean a suit of clothes.suit?No, you’d still have your clothes on—but, yes, I wouldn’t think much of you. Aren’t I your Rosalind?
