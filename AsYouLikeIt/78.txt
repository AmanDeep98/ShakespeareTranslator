Under the greenwood tree

Who loves to lie with me

And turn his merry note

Unto the sweet bird’s throat,

Come hither, come hither, come hither.

Here shall he see

No enemy

But winter and rough weather.
More, more, I prithee, more.It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy out
of a song as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more.
My voice is ragged. I know I cannot please you.I do not desire you to please me. I do desire you to sing.Come, more, another stanzo. Call you 'em “stanzos”?What you will, Monsieur Jaques.Nay, I care not for their names. They owe me nothing. Will
you sing?

Whoever wants to lie with me,

Under the greenwood tree,

And turn his merry song

To follow the sweet bird’s singing,

Come here, come here, come here.

Here you will find

No enemy

Besides winter and rough weather.
More, more, please, more.It’s only going to make you sad, Monsieur Jaques.I’m glad about that. More, please, more. I can suck sadness out of a song the way a weasel sucks eggs. More, please, more.My voice is ragged. I know I won’t please you.I don’t want you to please me, I want you to sing. Come on, another stanza—is that what you call 'em, “stanzas”?Call them whatever you want, Monsieur Jaques.Nah, I don’t care what their namesBy “names,” Jaques is thinking of the signatures on I.O.U notes, in which the name legally requires that the debt be honored.names are; they owe me nothing. Will you sing?
