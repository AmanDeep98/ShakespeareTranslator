Break an hour’s promise in love? He that will divide a
minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the
thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be
said of him that Cupid hath clapped him o' th' shoulder,
but I’ll warrant him heart-whole.
Pardon me, dear Rosalind.Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had as
lief be wooed of a snail.
Of a snail?Ay, of a snail, for though he comes slowly, he carries his
house on his head—a better jointure, I think, than you
make a woman. Besides, he brings his destiny with him.
What’s that?Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be beholding to
your wives for. But he comes armed in his fortune and
prevents the slander of his wife.
Virtue is no hornmaker, and my Rosalind is virtuous.And I am your Rosalind.
(as Aliena) It pleases him to call you so, but he hath aRosalind of a better leer than you.#LBSFORGOLDYou’d break a date with your beloved by a whole hour? A man who will dare to meet his lover even a thousandth part of a minute late—well, it’s possible he likes her, but I doubt he really loves the woman.Forgive me, darling Rosalind.No, if you’re ever late like this again, I’ll refuse to see you. I’d rather be wooed by a snail.A snail?Yes, a snail. Because even though he’s slow, he carries his house on his head—a better offer than you can make a woman, I think. Besides, he brings his fate with him.What fate is that?Why, his cuckold’s horns, of course—the kind you men are always blaming on your wives. See, the snail already has its horns, which prevents nasty rumors from spreading about his wife’s infidelity.A virtuous woman won’t give her husband horns, and my Rosalind is definitely virtuous.And I am your Rosalind.
(as Aliena) He likes calling you that, but he’s got another Rosalind out there with a prettier face.
