I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.Get you with him, you old dog.Is “old dog” my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in
your service. God be with my old master. He would not
have spoke such a word.

rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither.—Holla,
Dennis!

to you.

I’ll cure you of your insolence, and I’m not going to give you a thousand crowns, either!—Hey, Dennis!Did you call for me, your Worship?Wasn’t Charles, the duke’s wrestler, here to speak with me?Yes, sir, he’s here at the door right now and asks to see you.Call him in.I have a good plan.
