And I mine. I remember when I was in love I broke my
sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a-
night to Jane Smile. And I remember the kissing of her
batler, and the cow’s dugs that her pretty chopped hands
had milked. And I remember the wooing of a peascod
instead of her, from whom I took two cods and, giving her
them again, said with weeping tears, “Wear these for my
sake.” We that are true lovers run into strange capers. But
as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in
folly.
Thou speak’st wiser than thou art ware of.Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break my
shins against it.
Jove, Jove, this shepherd’s passionIs much upon my fashion.And mine, but it grows something stale with me.I pray you, one of you question yond man, if he for gold will
give us any food. I faint almost to death.

(to CORIN) Holla, you clown!Peace, fool. He’s not thy kinsman.Who calls?Your betters, sir.Else are they very wretched.#LBSFORGOLDMe too. I remember when I was in love, I broke my sword on a stone, and told him to take that for coming at night to see Jane Smile. I remember kissing her washing stick and the cow’s udders that her pretty, chapped hands had milked. I remember wooing a pea plant in her name, and then taking two pea pods and begging her to wear them “for my sake.” Those of us who are really in love will do the strangest things. But everything that lives is mortal, including the foolishness of love.You speak more wisely than you know.Nah, I’ll never be aware of my own wit, until I break my shins on it.By God! This shepherd’s condition is like my own.And like mine, but I’m getting a little tired of it.Please, one of you go ask that man over there if we can buy some food off him. I’m faint with hunger.
(to CORIN) Hey, clown!Shut up, fool. He’s not your relative.Who’s calling?Your superiors.If they weren’t my betters, they’d be pretty wretched indeed.
