We shall find a time, Audrey. Patience, gentle Audrey.Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old
gentleman’s saying.
A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext.
But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to
you.
Ay, I know who ’tis. He hath no interest in me in the world.Here comes the man you mean.It is meat and drink to me to see a clown. By my troth, we
that have good wits have much to answer for. We shall be
flouting. We cannot hold.
Good ev'n, Audrey.God gi' good ev'n, William.And good ev'n to you, sir.Good ev'n, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy head.Nay, prithee, be covered. How old are you, friend?#LBSFORGOLDWe’ll get married at some point, Audrey. Be patient.Really, the priest was good enough, no matter what that old guy said.No, he was wicked and vile. But Audrey, there’s a boy in the forest who claims you’re his girl.Yes, I know who you’re talking about, but he has no claim on me.Here comes the man himself.It warms my heart to encounter such a country bumpkin. Truly, we witty men can’t hold our tongues. We have to mess with the likes of him, we just can’t help it.Good evening, Audrey.Good evening, William.And good evening to you, sir.Good evening to you, good friend. No, no, put your hat back on, put it back on. No, please, keep your head covered. How old are you, friend?
