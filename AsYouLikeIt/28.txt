You must if you stay here, for here is the place appointed for
the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.

peril on his forwardness.
Is yonder the man?Even he, madam.Alas, he is too young. Yet he looks successfully.How now, daughter and cousin? Are you crept hither to see
the wrestling?

odds in the man. In pity of the challenger’s youth, I would
fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated. Speak to
him, ladies; see if you can move him.
Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.Do so. I’ll not be by.#LBSFORGOLDYou’re going to have to, if you stay here. This is the place they’re scheduled to wrestle, and they’re ready to go.Yes, I see them coming. Let’s stay and watch.Come on. Since the youth won’t be reasoned with, he’ll have to suffer for his stubbornness.Is that the man?That’s him, madam.Alas, he is too young. Yet he seems capable.What’s up, daughter and niece? Have you snuck over here to watch the wrestling?Yes, my lord, if you give us permission.You won’t enjoy it much, I can tell you, the odds are so against this young man.
