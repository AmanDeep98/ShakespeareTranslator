Cry “holla” to thy tongue, I prithee. It curvets
unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.
Oh, ominous! He comes to kill my heart.I would sing my song without a burden. Thou bring’st me
out of tune.
Do you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must
speak. Sweet, say on.
You bring me out. Soft, comes he not here?'Tis he. Slink by, and note him.I thank you for your company, but, good faith, I had as lief
have been myself alone.
And so had I, but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too for
your society.
God be wi' you. Let’s meet as little as we can.I do desire we may be better strangers.I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in
their barks.
I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill-
favoredly.
#LBSFORGOLDCry, “whoa!” to your tongue, please. It’s leaping about like a frisky horse. He was dressed like a hunter.Oh, that’s ominous! He has come to kill my heart.I’d like to sing my song solo. You’re making me go off-key.Don’t you know that I’m a woman? Whatever I think, I have to say. Sweetheart, go on.You’ve made me lose the tune. Quiet! Isn’t that him heading this way?That’s him. Let’s slink off, and watch him from a hiding place.Thanks for your company but, really, I would have preferred being alone.Me too, but still, for the sake of good manners, I’ll say thanks for your company.Goodbye. Let’s meet as little as we can.I also hope that we can be better strangers.Please don’t ruin any more trees by carving love poems on their barks.Please don’t ruin any more of my poems by reading them so badly.
