Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be.But were I not the better part made mercy,I should not seek an absent argumentOf my revenge, thou present. But look to it:Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is.Seek him with candle. Bring him, dead or living,Within this twelvemonth or turn thou no moreTo seek a living in our territory.Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thineWorth seizure, do we seize into our handsTill thou canst quit thee by thy brother’s mouthOf what we think against thee.Oh, that your Highness knew my heart in this:I never loved my brother in my life.More villain thou.—Well, push him out of doorsAnd let my officers of such a natureMake an extent upon his house and lands.Do this expediently, and turn him going.#LBSFORGOLDYou haven’t seen him since? Sir, sir, that can’t be true. If I weren’t a merciful man, I’d forget about your missing brother and punish you in his place. But do this: find your brother, wherever he is. Bring him here dead or alive within the next year, or get out off my land. I’m seizing your lands and all that you possess until your brother gives testimony that absolves you of any guilt.I wish your Highness knew my true feelings in this matter: I have never in my life loved my brother.That makes you an even bigger villain.—Well, throw him out, and have my officers seize his house and lands. Do this immediately, and send him packing.
