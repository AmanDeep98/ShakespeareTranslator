No more but that I know the more one sickens, the worse at
ease he is, and that he that wants money, means, and
content is without three good friends; that the property of
rain is to wet, and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat
sheep; and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun;
that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.
Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in court,
shepherd?
No, truly.Then thou art damned.Nay, I hope.Truly, thou art damned, like an ill-roasted egg, all on one
side.
For not being at court? Your reason.Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never saw’st good
manners; if thou never saw’st good manners, then thy
manners must be wicked, and wickedness is sin, and sin is
damnation. Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd.
#LBSFORGOLDOnly in that I know that the sicker one gets, the worse one feels, and that the man who lacks money, employment, and happiness is without three good friends. I know that rain makes things wet and fire burns things. I know that a good pasture makes sheep fat, that the main cause of night is the absence of sun, and that the man who isn’t smart by nature and hasn’t learned anything from his schooling will complain of his lack of good manners, or he comes from very dull parents indeed.You’re a natural-born philosopher! Were you ever at court, shepherd?Honestly, no.Then you are damned.I hope not.Yep, you’re damned like a roasted egg:Eggs were roasted in ashes and had to be rotated frequently to avoid burning.egg:  all on one side.I’m damned for not having been at court? Explain.Well, if you were never at court, you were never exposed to good manners; if you never witnessed good manners, your manners must be wicked; wickedness is a sin, and committing sins leads to damnation. You are in a perilous state, shepherd.
