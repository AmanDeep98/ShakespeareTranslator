Where dwell you, pretty youth?With this shepherdess, my sister, here in the skirts of the
forest like fringe upon a petticoat.
Are you native of this place?As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in
so removed a dwelling.
I have been told so of many. But indeed an old religious
uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an
inland man, one that knew courtship too well, for there he
fell in love. I have heard him read many lectures against it,
and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched with so
many giddy offenses as he hath generally taxed their whole
sex withal.
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to
the charge of women?
There were none principal. They were all like one another
as half-pence are, every one fault seeming monstrous till his
fellow fault came to match it.
I prithee, recount some of them.#LBSFORGOLDWhere do you live, pretty young man?With this shepherdess, my sister, on the outskirts of the forest. We live like fringe on the edges of a petticoat.Were you born here?Just like the rabbit, who lives where she is born.Your speech is more refined than I would expect in such a remote place as this.Many people have told me so. Actually, an old religious uncle of mine taught me how to speak, and he was brought up in the city. He knew too much about courtship, because he fell in love back there, and when he came here he constantly lectured against it. Thank God I’m not a woman and afflicted with all the giddiness that troubles that entire sex.What were the primary evils he claimed women were guilty of?There were no primary ones. All of women’s faults are as alike as one half-pence is to another. Each of a woman’s faults seems monstrous until you’re presented with the next one, which is just as bad.Please, tell me some of them.
