O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.I could find in my heart to disgrace my man’s apparel and
to cry like a woman, but I must comfort the weaker vessel,
as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to
petticoat. Therefore courage, good Aliena.
I pray you bear with me. I cannot go no further.For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you. Yet
I should bear no cross if I did bear you, for I think you have
no money in your purse.
Well, this is the Forest of Arden.Ay, now am I in Arden, the more fool I. When I was at homeI was in a better place, but travelers must be content.Ay, be so, good Touchstone.Look you who comes here, a young man and an old in
solemn talk.
