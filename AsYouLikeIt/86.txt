I think he be transformed into a beast,For I can nowhere find him like a man.My lord, he is but even now gone hence.Here was he merry, hearing of a song.If he, compact of jars, grow musical,We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.Go seek him. Tell him I would speak with him.He saves my labor by his own approach.Why, how now, monsieur? What a life is thisThat your poor friends must woo your company?What, you look merrily.A fool, a fool, I met a fool i' th' forest,A motley fool. A miserable world!As I do live by food, I met a fool,Who laid him down and basked him in the sunAnd railed on Lady Fortune in good terms,In good set terms, and yet a motley fool.“Good morrow, fool,” quoth I. “No, sir,” quoth he,“Call me not ‘fool’ till heaven hath sent me fortune.”#LBSFORGOLDI think he must have turned into an animal, because I can’t find him anywhere looking like a man.My lord, he just left here. He was happy here, listening to a song.If that man, who’s made up of conflicts, becomes musical, then there must be something wrong with the universe. Go find him. Tell him I want to speak with him.He saved me the trouble: here he comes.Well, what’s going on, mister? What kind of life do you lead that your poor friends must beg for your company? What, you look amused.A fool, a fool! I met a foolFools were conventionally distin guished by their motley (multi-colored) costumefool in the forest, wearing motley. What a miserable world! As sure as I eat to stay alive, I met a fool who was lying in the sun and complaining about his fortune. He spoke smartly, though he was a fool. “Good morning, fool,” I said. “No, sir,” he said, “don’t call me a fool until heaven has sent me my fortuneFortune is supposed to favor fools.fortune.”
