Mistress, you must come away to your father.Were you made the messenger?No, by mine honor, but I was bid to come for you.Where learned you that oath, fool?Of a certain knight that swore by his honor they were good
pancakes, and swore by his honor the mustard was naught.
Now, I’ll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the
mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.
How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge?Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins and swear by
your beards that I am a knave.
By our beards (if we had them), thou art.By my knavery (if I had it), then I were. But if you swear by
that that is not, you are not forsworn. No more was this
knight swearing by his honor, for he never had any; or if he
had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes
or that mustard.
#LBSFORGOLDMistress, you have to go see your father.Did they make you the messenger?No, by my honor, but they told me to come get youTouchstone is pretending that Celia meant, “Have you come to arrest us?” The term “messenger” was commonly used to describe some one who came with a warrant.get you.Where’d you learn a phrase like, “by my honor,” fool?From a certain knight who swore on his honor that the pancakes he was eating were good, and that the mustard on top of them—he swore on his honor—was bad. Now, I’ll swear to the opposite—that the pancakes were rotten, and the mustard was fine—but even so, the knight wasn’t lying.And how, out of your great heap of knowledge, will you manage to prove that?Yes, please; unleash your wisdom.Watch me: stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave.By our beards (if we had them), you are a knave.And I swear by my wickedness (if I had any) that I am a knave. But you can’t swear by what you don’t have—and this knight had no honor, or if he did, he swore it off before he ever saw those pancakes and that mustard.
