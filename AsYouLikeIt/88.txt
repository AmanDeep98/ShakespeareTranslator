And then he drew a dial from his pokeAnd, looking on it with lackluster eye,Says very wisely, “It is ten o'clock.Thus we may see,” quoth he, “how the world wags.'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,And after one hour more ’twill be eleven.And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,And then from hour to hour we rot and rot,And thereby hangs a tale.” When I did hearThe motley fool thus moral on the time,My lungs began to crow like chanticleerThat fools should be so deep-contemplative,And I did laugh sans intermissionAn hour by his dial. O noble fool!A worthy fool! Motley’s the only wear.What fool is this?O worthy fool!—One that hath been a courtierAnd says, “If ladies be but young and fair,They have the gift to know it.” And in his brain,Which is as dry as the remainder biscuitAfter a voyage, he hath strange places crammedWith observation, the which he ventsIn mangled forms. Oh, that I were a fool!I am ambitious for a motley coat.Thou shalt have one.#LBSFORGOLDThen he pulled a watch from his bag and, looking at it solemnly, said, “It’s ten o'clock. This way, we can see how the world moves. Only an hour ago it was nine, and in another hour it will be eleven. And so, from hour to hour we ripen, and from hour to hour we rot. And there’s a story behind that.” When I heard that motley fool moralizing on the subject of time, I began to crow like a rooster. Hearing a fool speaking so contemplatively made me laugh non-stop for an hour. Oh, noble fool! A worthy fool! Motley is the only thing to wear.Who is this fool?A worthy fool! He’s been a courtier and says, “If ladies  are young and pretty, they always know it.” His brainIn Shakespeare’s time, people thought different brains, with different amounts of moisture, processed information differently. A “dry” brain took a long time to be “impressed” by informationbrain is dry as a sailor’s biscuit and crammed with all sorts of strange observations, which he presents in mangled fashion. Oh, I wish I were a fool! I’m ambitious for one of those motley coats.You shall have one.
