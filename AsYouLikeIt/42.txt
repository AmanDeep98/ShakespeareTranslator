Why, cousin! Why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy, not a
word?
Not one to throw at a dog.No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs.Throw some of them at me. Come, lame me with reasons.Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should
be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any.
But is all this for your father?No, some of it is for my child’s father. Oh, how full of briers
is this working-day world!
They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday
foolery. If we walk not in the trodden paths our very
petticoats will catch them.
I could shake them off my coat. These burs are in my heart.Hem them away.I would try, if I could cry “hem” and have him.Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.#LBSFORGOLDWhat’s going on, Rosalind? Cupid have mercy! You won’t utter a single word?I don’t even have one to throw at a dog.No, your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs. Throw some of your words at me. Come on, throw your words at me like you would throw stones at a dog.Then there would be two cousins lying sick in bed: one hurt by reasons and the other gone crazy without any.Is all of this about your father?No, some of it is about my child’s father. Oh, this working-dayWorking-day=wearisome.working-day world is full of thorns!They’re only burrs, cousin, thrown at you because you took a holiday from conventional behavior. If we walk on the well-worn paths, they won’t get caught in our petticoats.Those burrs I could shake off my clothing, but these are in my heart.Cough them up.I’d try it, if I could cry “hem” and have him.Come on, take control of your feelings.
