Tomorrow is the joyful day, Audrey. Tomorrow will we be
married.
I do desire it with all my heart, and I hope it is no dishonest
desire to desire to be a woman of the world.
Here comes two of the banished duke’s pages.Well met, honest gentleman.By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and a song.We are for you. Sit i' th' middle.Shall we clap into ’t roundly, without hawking or spitting or
saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues to a bad
voice?
I' faith, i' faith, and both in a tune like two gypsies on a
horse.

(sing)

It was a lover and his lass,

With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no,

That o'er the green cornfield did pass

In springtime, the only pretty ring time,

When birds do sing, Hey ding a ding, ding.

Sweet lovers love the spring.

Between the acres of the rye,
#LBSFORGOLDTomorrow is the happy day, Audrey. We’ll be married tomorrow.I can’t wait. I hope it doesn’t make me unchaste that I really
								want to be a married woman. Here come two of Duke Senior’s pages.Good afternoon, good gentleman.It really is good to see you. Come, sit, sit, and sing me a song.Sounds good to us. Sit between us.Should we just get down to it? Should we skip all that hacking and spitting and saying that we’re hoarse, which only makes clear what lousy singers we are?Yes, yes, and let’s sing in unison, like two gypsies riding on a single horse.
(singing)

There was a lover and his girl,

With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no,

Who walked through the cornfield

In the springtime, the only proper wedding time,

The time when birds sing, Hey ding-a-ding-ding.

Sweet lovers love the spring.

Between the acres of rye,
