But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
should be hanged and carved upon these trees?
I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you
came, for look here what I found on a palm tree. I was never
so berhymed since Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat,
which I can hardly remember.
Trow you who hath done this?Is it a man?And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck. Change
you color?
I prithee, who?O Lord, Lord, it is a hard matter for friends to meet, but
mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so
encounter.
Nay, but who is it?Is it possible?Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell
me who it is.
O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful wonderful,
and yet again wonderful, and after that, out of all
whooping!
#LBSFORGOLDBut did you listen to all that poetry without even wondering about what your name is doing on all these trees?I was working through my wonder when you arrived. Look at what I found on a palm tree. I haven’t been rhymed about like this since my past life, when I was  an Irish ratIn Ireland, poets aimed satirical verses at their enemies. Supposedly, they killed rats by rhyming them to death.Irish rat, but I can hardly remember that.Do you know who wrote these?Was it a man?And he had a chain that once belonged to you hanging around his neck. Are you blushing?Please, who?Oh God, God! It’s difficult to bring two friends together, but even mountains can be moved together by earthquakes.No, who are you talking about?Is it possible?No, I’m begging you now, tell me who it is.Oh, this is wonderful, wonderful—just wonderful wonderful! And another wonderful, and beyond-my-ability-to-express wonderful!
