Sweet Phoebe—Ha, what sayst thou, Silvius?Sweet Phoebe, pity me.Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.If you do sorrow at my grief in love,By giving love your sorrow and my griefWere both extermined.Thou hast my love. Is not that neighborly?I would have you.Why, that were covetousness.Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,And yet it is not that I bear thee love,But since that thou canst talk of love so well,Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,I will endure, and I’ll employ thee too.But do not look for further recompenseThan thine own gladness that thou art employed.So holy and so perfect is my love,And I in such a poverty of grace,That I shall think it a most plenteous cropTo glean the broken ears after the manThat the main harvest reaps. Loose now and thenA scattered smile, and that I’ll live upon.Know’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?#LBSFORGOLDSweet Phoebe—What? Did you say something, Silvius?Sweet Phoebe, have pity on me.Well, I’m sorry for you, gentle Silvius.But if you’re really sorry for me, you can cure me. If you’re sorry for the grief I feel in loving you, you can love me back. Then both my grief and your sorrow will be cured.You have my friendship. Isn’t that enough?I want you.Well, that’s just greedy. Silvius, I used to hate you. I still don’t love you, but since you’re well-spoken when it comes to love, I’ll keep you around and make use of you. But don’t expect any more than that.My love for you is so pure and perfect, and I’m in such a bad way, that I’ll be grateful for whatever leftover love you throw my way. Every once in a while, toss me a distracted smile, and I’ll live on that.Do you know the boy who was just speaking to me?
