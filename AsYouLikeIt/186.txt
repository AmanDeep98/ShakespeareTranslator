Which is he that killed the deer?Sir, it was I.Let’s present him to the duke like a Roman conqueror. And
it would do well to set the deer’s horns upon his head for a
branch of victory.—Have you no song, forester, for this
purpose?
Yes, sir.Sing it. 'Tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise
enough.

What shall he have that killed the deer?

His leather skin and horns to wear.

Then sing him home.

(The rest shall bear this burden.)

Take thou no scorn to wear the horn.

It was a crest ere thou wast born.

Thy father’s father wore it,

And thy father bore it.

The horn, the horn, the lusty horn

Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.

What should we give to the man who killed this deer?

Give him the hide and the horns to wear.

Then sing this song to send him home

Don’t be ashamed to wear the horns.

They’ve been worn since before you were born.

Your father’s father wore it,

And your father endured it.

The horn, the horn, the lustful horn

Is not to be laughed at or scorned.
