What woman in the city do I name,When that I say the city-woman bearsThe cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?Who can come in and say that I mean her,When such a one as she such is her neighbor?Or what is he of basest functionThat says his bravery is not of my cost,Thinking that I mean him, but therein suitsHis folly to the mettle of my speech?There then. How then, what then? Let me see whereinMy tongue hath wronged him. If it do him right,Then he hath wronged himself. If he be free,Why then my taxing like a wild goose fliesUnclaimed of any man. But who comes here?Forbear, and eat no more.Why, I have eat none yet.Nor shalt not till necessity be served.Of what kind should this cock come of?Art thou thus boldened, man, by thy distressOr else a rude despiser of good manners,That in civility thou seem’st so empty?You touched my vein at first. The thorny pointOf bare distress hath ta'en from me the showOf smooth civility, yet am I inland bredAnd know some nurture. But forbear, I say.He dies that touches any of this fruitTill I and my affairs are answerèd.#LBSFORGOLDWhat woman in the city am I talking about when I say that the clothes on a city-woman’s unworthy back are rich enough to suit a prince? Who can say I mean just her when all her neighbors are exactly like her? And when some lowlife protests that his fancy clothes aren’t my problem, isn’t he basically admitting that I’m talking about him? Well, then. Tell me how I’ve wronged him. If I was right about him, he’s the one who’s done wrong. If he isn’t guilty of the faults I’m talking about, well then, my accusations fly by like wild geese, whom no one owns, since they don’t apply to any man. But who is this?Stop, and eat no more.But I haven’t eaten anything yet.And you won’t until the needy eat.What kind of fighting cock is this?Are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners? Why do you seem so lacking in civility?You were right the first time. My piercing distress has stripped me of smooth manners. But I wasn’t raised in the forest, and I was somewhat well-bred. But stop, I say. Whoever eats this fruit before I’ve been taken care of dies.
