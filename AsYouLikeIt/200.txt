He sent me hither, stranger as I am,To tell this story, that you might excuseHis broken promise, and to give this napkinDyed in his blood unto the shepherd youthThat he in sport doth call his Rosalind.Why, how now, Ganymede, sweet Ganymede?Many will swoon when they do look on blood.There is more in it.—Cousin Ganymede.Look, he recovers.I would I were at home.We’ll lead you thither.—I pray you, will you take him by the arm?Be of good cheer, youth. You a man? You lack a man’s heart.I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think this was
well-counterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how well I
counterfeited. Heigh-ho.

your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.
Counterfeit, I assure you.Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.#LBSFORGOLDhe sent me out to find you, even though I’m a stranger to you.

Please, will you take his arm?Buck up, boy! You’re a man? You don’t have a man’s courage.It’s true, I confess. Oh, sir, someone would think I was a good fake. Please tell your brother what a convincing show I put on. Whoo-hoo!That was no show. Your cheeks are too flushed for me to believe that was a fake faint.Fake, I’m telling you.Well, then, be brave and pretend to be a man.
