Who comes here?Mistress and master, you have oft inquiredAfter the shepherd that complained of love,Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,Praising the proud disdainful shepherdessThat was his mistress.
(as Aliena)  Well, and what of him?If you will see a pageant truly playedBetween the pale complexion of true loveAnd the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you,If you will mark it.
(aside to  CELIA)  O, come, let us remove.The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.—(as Ganymede) Bring us to this sight, and you shall sayI’ll prove a busy actor in their play.#LBSFORGOLDWho’s coming here?Mistress and master, you’ve often asked about that lovelorn shepherd you once saw me sitting with, the one who complained about the disdainful shepherdess he was in love with.Yes, what about him?If you’d like to see a scene played out between a man growing pale with unrequited love and a woman glowing with scorn and proud disdain, come with me a short distance and you’ll witness it.
(speaking so that only  CELIA can hear)  Come on, let’s go. The sight of lovers nourishes whoever else is in love. (to  CORIN)  Bring us to this little show, and I’ll take a part in their play.
