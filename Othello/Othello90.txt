Indeed she’s a most fresh and delicate creature.What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley to
		    provocation.An inviting eye, and yet methinks right modest.And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?She is indeed perfection.Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a stoup
			of wine, and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would
			fain have a measure to the health of black Othello.Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains for
			drinking. I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom
			of entertainment.Oh, they are our friends. But one cup. I’ll drink for
			you.I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily qualified
			too, and behold what innovation it makes here. I am unfortunate in
			the infirmity, and dare not task my weakness with any more.What, man, ’tis a night of revels! The gallants desire
			it.Where are they?Here at the door. I pray you call them in.I’ll do ’t, but it dislikes me.#LBSFORGOLDYes, she’s young and tender.And such pretty eyes! Like an invitation.Yes, she’s pretty. But she’s modest and
			ladylike too.And when she speaks, doesn’t her voice stir up
		    passion?She’s a perfect woman, it’s true.Well, good luck to them tonight in bed! Come with us, lieutenant.
			I’ve got a jug of wine, and these two Cyprus gentlemen
			want to drink a toast to the black Othello.Not tonight, Iago. I’m not much of a drinker. I wish
			there was less social pressure to drink.Oh, but these are our friends. Just one glass. I’ll do
			most of the drinking for you.I’ve already had a glass of wine tonight, watered down,
			but look how drunk I am. I’m not a heavy drinker. I
			wouldn’t dare drink much more than that.What are you talking about, man? Tonight is for celebrating! The
			gentlemen are waiting.Where are they?By the door. Please invite them in.I’ll do it, but I don’t like it.
