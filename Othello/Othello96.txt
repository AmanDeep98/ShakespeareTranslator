For mine own part, no offence to the general nor any man of
			quality, I hope to be saved.And so do I too, lieutenant.Ay, but (by your leave) not before me. The lieutenant is to be
			saved before the ancient. Let’s have no more of this,
			let’s to our affairs.—Forgive us our
			sins!—Gentlemen, let’s look to our business.
			Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk. This is my ancient, this is my
			right hand, and this is my left. I am not drunk now. I can stand
			well enough, and I speak well enough.Excellent well!Why, very well then. You must not think then that I am
		    drunk.To th' platform, masters. Come, let’s set
			the watch.You see this fellow that is gone before,He is a soldier fit to stand by CaesarAnd give direction. And do but see his vice,'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,The one as long as th' other. 'Tis pity of
			him.I fear the trust Othello puts him inOn some odd time of his infirmityWill shake this island.    But is he often
			thus?#LBSFORGOLDSpeaking for myself—and no offense to the general or
			anyone else—I hope I’m going to heaven.Me too, lieutenant.Okay, but please not before me. The lieutenant has to get to
			heaven before the ensign. But let’s stop this drinking
			and get down to business.—God forgive our
			sins!—Gentlemen, let’s get down to business.
			By the way, I don’t want anyone thinking I’m
			drunk. This is my ensign. This is my right hand, and this is my left
			hand.I’m not drunk. I can stand well enough, and I can speak
			just fine.Yes, you’re speaking very well.Yes, very well. So don’t think that I’m
			drunk.Let’s go to the platform where we’ll stand
			guard. Come on.You see that man who just left? He’s a good soldier,
			good enough to be Caesar’s right-hand man. But he has a
			serious weakness. It’s too bad. I’m worried
			that Othello trusts him too much, and it’ll be bad for
			Cyprus eventually.But is he often like this?
