With any strong or vehement importunity.Much will be seen in that. In the meantime,Let me be thought too busy in my fears—As worthy cause I have to fear I am—And hold her free, I do beseech your honor.Fear not my government.    I once more take
                                my leave.This fellow’s of exceeding honestyAnd knows all quantities, with a learnèd spirit,Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,I’d whistle her off and let her down the windTo prey at fortune. Haply, for I am blackAnd have not those soft parts of conversationThat chamberers have, or for I am declinedInto the vale of years—yet that’s not
                                much—She’s gone, I am abused, and my reliefMust be to loathe her. Oh, curse of marriageThat we can call these delicate creatures oursAnd not their appetites! I had rather be a toadAnd live upon the vapor of a dungeonThan keep a corner in the thing I loveFor others' uses. Yet ’tis the plague to
                                great ones,Prerogatived are they less than the base.'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.Even then this forkèd plague is fated to usWhen we do quicken. Look where she comes.If she be false, heaven mocked itself.I’ll not believe ’t.#LBSFORGOLDgiving it back to him. That will tell you a lot. But in the
                                meantime, just assume that I’m paranoid—as
                                I’m pretty sure I am—and keep thinking
                                she’s innocent, please.Don’t worry about how I handle it.I’ll say goodbye once more.This Iago is extremely honest and good, and he knows a lot about
                                human behavior. If it turns out that she really is running around on
                                me, I’ll send her away, even though it’ll
                                break my heart. Maybe because I’m black, and I
                                don’t have nice manners like courtiers do, or because
                                I’m getting old—but that’s not
                                much—She’s gone, and I’ve been
                                cheated on. I have no choice but to hate her. Oh what a curse
                                marriage is! We think our beautiful wives belong to us, but their
                                desires are free! I’d rather be a toad in a moldy
                                basement than to have only a part of someone I love, sharing the
                                rest of her with others. This is the plague of important
                                men—our wives betray us more than those of poor men.
                                It’s our destiny, like death. We are destined to be
                                betrayed when we are born. Oh, here she comes.If she’s cheated on me, then heaven itself is a fake. I
                                don’t believe it.
