'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.He’ll watch the horologe a double setIf drink rock not his cradle.    It were wellThe general were put in mind of it.Perhaps he sees it not, or his good naturePrizes the virtue that appears in CassioAnd looks not on his evils. Is not this true?
(aside) How now, Roderigo?I pray you, after the lieutenant, go!And ’tis great pity that the noble MoorShould hazard such a place as his own secondWith one of an ingraft infirmity.It were an honest action to saySo to the Moor.    Not I, for this

(speaking so that only RODERIGO
			    can hear) Hello, Roderigo.
			Please, follow the lieutenant. Hurry! Go!And it’s too bad that the Moor chose a man with such a
			deep-rooted drinking problem as his second-in-command. We should
			definitely say something to the Moor.I wouldn’t say anything, not if you gave me the whole
			island for doing so. I respect Cassio and I’d like to
			help cure his alcoholism—What’s that noise?
