O gentle lady, do not put me to ’t,For I am nothing, if not critical.Come on, assay. There’s one gone to the harbor?Ay, madam.I am not merry, but I do beguileThe thing I am by seeming otherwise.Come, how wouldst thou praise me?I am about it, but indeed my inventionComes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze,It plucks out brains and all. But my Muse laborsAnd thus she is delivered:If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,The one’s for use, the other useth it.Well praised! How if she be black and witty?If she be black, and thereto have a wit,She’ll find a white that shall her blackness
		    fit.Worse and worse!    How if fair and
			foolish?She never yet was foolish that was fair,For even her folly helped her to an heir.These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'
			th' alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for herThat’s foul and foolish?There’s none so foul and foolish thereunto,But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.#LBSFORGOLDDon’t make me do it, my lady. I’m critical
			by nature.Come on, just try.—By the way, has someone gone down to
			the harbor?Yes, madam.I’m not as happy as I seem. I’m just trying
			not to show how worried I am about Othello’s safety. Come
			on, what would you say about me?I’m trying to think of something, but I’m
			not good at inventing clever things. It takes time. Ah,
			I’ve got it. If a woman is pretty and smart, she uses her
			good looks to get what she wants.Very clever! But what if the woman is smart but ugly?Even if she’s ugly, she’ll be smart enough
			to find a guy to sleep with her.This is getting worse and worse!What if she’s pretty but stupid?No pretty woman is stupid, because her stupidity will make her
			more attractive to men.These are stupid old jokes that men tell each other in bars. What
			horrible thing do you have to say about a woman who’s
			both ugly and stupid?No matter how ugly or stupid the woman is, she plays the same
			dirty tricks that the smart and pretty ones do.
