    Pray heaven it beState matters, as you think, and no conceptionNor no jealous toy concerning you.Alas the day! I never gave him cause.But jealous souls will not be answered so.They are not ever jealous for the cause,But jealous for they’re jealous. It is a monsterBegot upon itself, born on itself.Heaven keep the monster from Othello’s mind!Lady, amen.I will go seek him.—Cassio, walk hereabout.If I do find him fit, I’ll move your suitAnd seek to effect it to my uttermost.I humbly thank your ladyship.Save you, friend Cassio!#LBSFORGOLDI hope to God it’s something political, like you think,
                                and not jealousy involving you.Oh no! I never gave him reason to be jealous.But jealous people don’t think like that.
                                They’re never jealous for a reason; they’re
                                just jealous. It’s like a monster that just grows and
                                grows, out of nothing.I hope God keeps that monster from growing in Othello’s
                                mind!Amen to that, lady.I’ll go look for him—Cassio, stay around
                                here. If he’s in a good mood I’ll mention you
                                again, and do everything I can.I thank you, lady.Hello, Cassio!
