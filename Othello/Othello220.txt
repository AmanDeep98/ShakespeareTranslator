You have seen nothing then?Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.But then I saw no harm, and then I heardEach syllable that breath made up between them.What, did they never whisper?Never, my lord.Nor send you out o' th' way?Never.To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?Never, my lord.That’s strange.I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,Lay down my soul at stake. If you think otherRemove your thought, it doth abuse your bosom.If any wretch have put this in your headLet heaven requite it with the serpent’s curseFor if she be not honest, chaste, and trueThere’s no man happy. The purest of their wivesIs foul as slander.#LBSFORGOLDYou haven’t seen anything, then?No, and I didn’t hear anything either, or suspect
                                anything at all.But you’ve seen her and Cassio together.Yes, but I didn’t see anything wrong, and I heard every
                                syllable they said.Didn’t they ever whisper?Never, my lord.Or ask you to leave the room?Never.Not even to get her fan, or her gloves, or her mask, or
                            anything?No, my lord.That’s strange.I’d swear to you on my soul that she’s a
                                good, honest person, sir. If you suspect otherwise, stop thinking
                                that right now because you’re wrong. If any jerk has
                                tried to convince you she’s bad, I hope God curses him.
                                If she’s not honest, faithful, and true, then
                                there’s no such thing as a faithful wife or a happy
                                husband.
