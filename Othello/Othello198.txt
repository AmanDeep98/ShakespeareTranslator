Bade him anon return and here speak with me,The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scornsThat dwell in every region of his face.For I will make him tell the tale anewWhere, how, how oft, how long ago, and whenHe hath, and is again to cope your wife.I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,And nothing of a man.    Dost thou hear,
                                Iago?I will be found most cunning in my patience,But—dost thou hear?—most bloody.      That’s
                                not amiss,But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,A huswife that by selling her desiresBuys herself bread and clothes. It is a creatureThat dotes on Cassio, as ’tis the strumpet’s
                                plagueTo beguile many and be beguiled by one.He, when he hears of her, cannot refrainFrom the excess of laughter. Here he comes.As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad.And his unbookish jealousy must construePoor Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and light behaviorQuite in the wrong.—How do you now, lieutenant?#LBSFORGOLDat you. I’ll make him tell me the whole story
                                again—where, how often, how long ago—and when
                                he plans to sleep with your wife in the future. I’m
                                telling you, just watch his face. But stay calm, and
                                don’t get carried away by rage, or I’ll think
                                you’re not a man.Do you hear what I’m saying, Iago? I’ll be
                                very patient, but—do you hear
                                me?—I’m not done with him yetThat’s fine, but for now keep your cool. Will you go
                                hide?Now I’ll ask Cassio about Bianca, a prostitute who
                                sells her body for food and clothes. She’s crazy about
                                Cassio. That’s the whore’s curse, to seduce
                                many men, but to be seduced by one. Whenever he talks about her he
                                can’t stop laughing.And when he laughs, Othello will go crazy. In his ignorant
                                jealousy, he’ll totally misunderstand Cassio’s
                                smiles, gestures, and jokes.—How are you,
                            lieutenant?
