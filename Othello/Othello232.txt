Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,That true hearts cannot bear it.Am I that name, Iago?What name, fair lady?Such as she says my lord did say I was.He called her “whore.” A beggar in his drinkCould not have laid such terms upon his callet.Why did he so?I do not know. I am sure I am none such.Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!Hath she forsook so many noble matches,Her father and her country, and her friends,To be called “whore”? Would it not make one
                                weep?It is my wretched fortune.    Beshrew him for
                                ’t!How comes this trick upon him?    Nay, heaven doth
                                know.I will be hanged, if some eternal villain,Some busy and insinuating rogue,Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,Have not devised this slander. I will be hanged else!#LBSFORGOLDHe called her a whore so many times, and heaped up so much abuse
                                on her that good people can’t stand to hear it.Am I that name, Iago?What name, madam?What my lord said I was.He called her a whore. A beggar couldn’t have called
                                his slut worse names.Why did he do that?I don’t know. I just know I’m not
                            one.Don’t cry, don’t cry. What a day this
                            is!Did she give up all those chances to marry noblemen, give up her
                                father and country and friends, just to be called a whore?
                                Doesn’t that make you want to cry?It’s just my bad luck.Damn him! How did he get such an idea?Heaven knows.I bet my life some evil busybody, some meddling, lying jerk made
                                up this rumor to get some position. I bet my life on it.
