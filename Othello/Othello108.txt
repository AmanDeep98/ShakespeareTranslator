But men are men, the best sometimes forget.Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,As men in rage strike those that wish them best,Yet surely Cassio, I believe, receivedFrom him that fled some strange indignityWhich patience could not pass.    I know, Iago,Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love theeBut never more be officer of mine.—Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!I’ll make thee an example.What’s the matter, dear?All’s well, sweeting,Come away to bed.—(to
			    MONTANO) Sir, for your hurtsMyself will be your surgeon. Lead him off.Iago, look with care about the townAnd silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.—Come, Desdemona, ’tis the soldiers' lifeTo have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.What, are you hurt, lieutenant?Ay, past all surgery.Marry, heaven forbid!#LBSFORGOLDBut nobody’s perfect, and even the best man sometimes
			loses control and strikes out in rage. Cassio was wrong to hurt
			Montano, who was only trying to help him, but I’m sure
			the guy who ran away must have offended Cassio in some terrible way,
			and Cassio couldn’t let it pass.Iago, I know you’re fond of Cassio and are downplaying
			this for his benefit. Cassio, I love you, but you’re
			never again going to be one of my officers.—Look, you’ve woken my wife! I’ll make you an
			example for the others to learn from.What’s the matter, dear?Everything’s fine, now, sweetheart. Go back to
			bed.— (to MONTANO) I’ll see to it personally
			that your wounds are treated. Lead him off.Iago, go and calm down the townspeople.—Come with me,
			Desdemona. Unfortunately, it’s part of the
			soldier’s life to be woken up by trouble.Are you hurt, lieutenant?Yes, but no doctor can help me.Oh I hope that’s not true!
