    Alas, alas!It is not honesty in me to speakWhat I have seen and known. You shall observe him,And his own courses will denote him soThat I may save my speech. Do but go afterAnd mark how he continues.I am sorry that I am deceived in him.#LBSFORGOLDOh, it’s too bad! It wouldn’t be right for
                                me to tell you everything I’ve seen and heard.
                                You’ll see what he’s like. His own actions
                                will show you what kind of person he is, so I won’t have
                                to bother telling you. Just go after him and watch what he does
                                next.I’m sorry I was so wrong about him.
