Honest, ay, honest.My lord, for aught I know.    What dost thou
                                think?Think, my lord?“Think, my lord?” Alas, thou
                                echo’st meAs if there were some monster in thy thoughtToo hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something.I heard thee say even now thou lik’st not thatWhen Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?And when I told thee he was of my counselOf my whole course of wooing, thou cried’st
                                “Indeed?”And didst contract and purse thy brow togetherAs if thou then hadst shut up in thy brainSome horrible conceit. If thou dost love meShow me thy thought.My lord, you know I love you.I think thou dost.And for I know thou 'rt full of love and honestyAnd weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st
                                them breath,Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more.For such things in a false disloyal knaveAre tricks of custom, but in a man that’s justThey are close dilations, working from the heart,That passion cannot rule.    For Michael
                                Cassio,I dare be sworn, I think, that he is honest.I think so too.#LBSFORGOLDHonest, yes, honest.As far as I know, sir.What are you thinking?Thinking, my lord?“Thinking, my lord?” My God, you keep
                                repeating everything I say as if you were thinking something too
                                horrible to say out loud. You’re thinking something. Just
                                a minute ago I heard you say you didn’t like it when
                                Cassio left my wife. What didn’t you like? And when I
                                told you he was involved the whole time I was trying to get
                                Desdemona, you were like, “Oh, really?” And
                                then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were
                                imagining something horrible. If you’re my friend, tell
                                me what you’re thinking.My lord, you know I’m your friend.I think you are. And I know you’re full of love and
                                honesty, and you think carefully before you speak. That’s
                                why these pauses of yours frighten me. If some fool were withholding
                                things from me, I wouldn’t think twice about it. If some
                                lying, cheating villain acted like that, it would just be a trick.
                                But when an honest man acts like that, you know he’s
                                wrestling with bad thoughts and can’t help it.As for Michael Cassio, I think it would be safe for me to swear
                                that he’s honest.I think so too.
