Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?I dare not say he lies anywhere.Why, man?He’s a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,
                                ’tis stabbing.Go to. Where lodges he?To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.Can anything be made of this?I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging and say
                                he lies here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own
                            throat.Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?I will catechize the world for him, that is, make questions, and
                                by them answer.Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my lord on
                                his behalf, and hope all will be well.To do this is within the compass of man’s wit, and
                                therefore I will attempt the doing it.#LBSFORGOLDExcuse me, do you know which room Lieutenant Cassio lies inlies in = sleeps inlies in?I wouldn’t dare say he lies anywhere.Why do you say that?He’s a soldier. If I accused a soldier of lying,
                                he’d stab me.Oh, come on. Where does he sleep?Telling you where he’s sleeping is like telling you
                                where I’m lying.What on earth does that mean?I don’t know where he’s staying, so if I
                                told you he’s sleeping here or there, I’d be
                                lying.Can you ask around and find out?I’ll go ask questions everywhere.Find him and tell him to come here. Tell him I’ve
                                spoken to my husband on his behalf, and I think everything will be
                                all right.I think I can do that. It’s not too much to ask.
