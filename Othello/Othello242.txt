Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups tonight
                                with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him. He knows not yet of
                                his honorable fortune. If you will watch his going thence (which I
                                will fashion to fall out between twelve and one) you may take him at
                                your pleasure. I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall
                                fall between us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me.
                                I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think
                                yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high suppertime, and the
                                night grows to waste. About it!I will hear further reason for this.And you shall be satisfied.#LBSFORGOLDYes, if you want to help yourself. He’s having dinner
                                tonight with a prostitute, and I’ll go visit him. He
                                doesn’t know he’s been appointed governor yet.
                                When you see him walking by here (as I’ll make sure he
                                does between twelve and one) you can nab him. I’ll be
                                nearby to help you, and between the two of us we can handle him.
                                Come on, don’t stand there in a daze. Come along with me.
                                I’ll give you such reasons for killing him that
                                you’ll feel obliged to snuff him out. It’s
                                nearly dinner time, and the night’s going to be wasted.
                                Let’s go!I want to hear more about this.You will. You’ll hear all you want to hear.
