The Anthropophagi, and men whose headsGrew beneath their shoulders. These things to hearWould Desdemona seriously incline.But still the house affairs would draw her hence,Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,She’d come again, and with a greedy earDevour up my discourse, which I, observing,Took once a pliant hour and found good meansTo draw from her a prayer of earnest heartThat I would all my pilgrimage dilate,Whereof by parcels she had something heardBut not intentively. I did consent,And often did beguile her of her tearsWhen I did speak of some distressful strokeThat my youth suffered. My story being doneShe gave me for my pains a world of sighs.She swore, in faith, ’twas strange, ’twas
			passing strange,'Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful.She wished she had not heard it, yet she wishedThat heaven had made her such a man. She thanked meAnd bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,I should but teach him how to tell my storyAnd that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake.She loved me for the dangers I had passed,And I loved her that she did pity them.This only is the witchcraft I have used.Here comes the lady. Let her witness it.I think this tale would win my daughter too.Good Brabantio. Take up this mangled matter at the best.Men do their broken weapons rather useThan their bare hands.#LBSFORGOLDWhen I was relaxing, she’d pull me aside and ask to
			hear some part of a story she had missed. Her eyes would fill with
			tears at the bad things I went through in my younger years. When my
			stories were done, she’d sigh and tell me how strangely
			wonderful and sad my life had been. She said she wished she
			hadn’t heard it, but she also wished there was a man like
			me for her. She thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine had
			a story like mine to tell, she’d fall in love with him. I
			took the hint and spoke to her. She said she loved me for the
			dangers I’d survived, and I loved her for feeling such
			strong emotions about me. That’s the only witchcraft I
			ever used. Here comes my wife now. She’ll confirm
			everything.I think a story like that would win my own daughter over.
			Brabantio, I urge you to make the best of this. Try to accept
			what’s happened.
