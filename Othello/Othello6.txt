And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,It is as sure as you are Roderigo,Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.In following him, I follow but myself.Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,But seeming so, for my peculiar end.For when my outward action doth demonstrateThe native act and figure of my heartIn compliment extern, ’tis not long afterBut I will wear my heart upon my sleeveFor daws to peck at. I am not what I am.What a full fortune does the Thick-lips oweIf he can carry’t thus!    Call up her
			father.Rouse him. Make after him, Poison his delight,Proclaim him in the streets. Incense her kinsmen,And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,Plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joyYet throw such changes of vexation on’t,As it may lose some color.Here is her father’s house, I’ll call
		    aloud.Do, with like timorous accent and dire yellAs when, by night and negligence, the fireIs spied in populous cities.What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!Awake! What, ho, Brabantio! Thieves! Thieves!Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!Thieves! thieves!#LBSFORGOLDyou, as sure as your name’s Roderigo, if I were the
			Moor I wouldn’t want to be Iago. I may seem to love and
			obey him, but in fact, I’m just serving him to get what I
			want. If my outward appearance started reflecting what I really
			felt, soon enough I’d be wearing my heart on my sleeve
			for birds to peck at. No, it’s better to hide it.
			I’m not who I appear to be.
Thick-lips“Thick-lips” is a racial slur toward the Moor, Othello.Thick-lips sure is lucky if he can pull this off!Let’s shout up to Desdemona’s father, wake
			him, pester him, spoil his happiness, spread rumors about him in the
			streets, enrage his relatives, and irritate him endlessly. However
			real his happiness is, it will vanish in light of this.Here’s her father’s house. I’ll
			call out.Do it, and shout like the city’s on fire.Hey, Brabantio! Signor Brabantio, hey!Wake up, Brabantio! Wake up! Thieves! Thieves! Check on your
			daughter, your house, your money! Thieves! Thieves!
