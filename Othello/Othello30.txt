How say you by this change?    This cannot be,By no assay of reason. 'Tis a pageant,To keep us in false gaze. When we considerTh' importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,And let ourselves again but understandThat as it more concerns the Turk than RhodesSo may he with more facile question bear it,For that it stands not in such warlike braceBut altogether lacks th' abilitiesThat Rhodes is dressed in. If we make thought of thisWe must not think the Turk is so unskillfulTo leave that latest which concerns him first,Neglecting an attempt of ease and gainTo wake and wage a danger profitless.Nay, in all confidence, he’s not for Rhodes.Here is more news.The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes,Have there injointed them with an after fleet.Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?Of thirty sail. And now they do re-stemTheir backward course, bearing with frank appearanceTheir purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,Your trusty and most valiant servitor,With his free duty recommends you thus,And prays you to believe him.#LBSFORGOLDWhat do you think about this change?They can’t have changed; there’s no way this
			could be true. It’s a trick to confuse us. Think about
			how important Cyprus is to the Turks, and remember that they could
			capture Cyprus more easily, since it isn’t as well
			protected as Rhodes is. If we keep these things in mind, we
			can’t possibly imagine that the Turks would be so
			incompetent as to put off for last what they want to achieve first,
			setting aside something easy and profitable to do something
			dangerous and pointless.No, I think we can be confident that the Turks aren’t
			really headed for Rhodes.Here’s some more news coming in.Sir, the Turks sailed to Rhodes, where they joined with another
			fleet.That’s just what I thought. How many, can you
		    guess?Thirty ships. Now they’ve turned around and are clearly
			heading for Cyprus. Signor Montano, your brave and loyal servant,
			gives you this information and asks you to send reinforcements to
			relieve him.
