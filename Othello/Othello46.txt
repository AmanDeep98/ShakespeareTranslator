I crave fit disposition for my wife.Due reference of place and exhibition,With such accommodation and besortAs levels with her breeding.Why, at her father’s.I’ll not have it so.Nor I.Nor would I there reside,To put my father in impatient thoughtsBy being in his eye. Most gracious Duke,To my unfolding lend your prosperous earAnd let me find a charter in your voice,T' assist my simpleness.What would you, Desdemona?That I did love the Moor to live with him,My downright violence and storm of fortunesMay trumpet to the world. My heart’s subduedEven to the very quality of my lord.I saw Othello’s visage in his mind,And to his honors and his valiant partsDid I my soul and fortunes consecrate.So that, dear lords, if I be left behindA moth of peace and he go to the war,The rites for which I love him are bereft me,And I a heavy interim shall supportBy his dear absence. Let me go with him.Let her have your voice.Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it notTo please the palate of my appetite,#LBSFORGOLDgiving her a place to live and people to keep her company that
