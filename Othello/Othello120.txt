			morrow, general.”Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that they speak
			i' th' nose thus?How, sir? How?Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?Ay, marry, are they, sir.Oh, thereby hangs a tail.Whereby hangs a tale, sir?Marry sir, by many a wind instrument that I know. But, masters,
			here’s money for you, and the general so likes your music
			that he desires you, for love’s sake, to make no more
			noise with it.Well, sir, we will not.#LBSFORGOLDMusicians, start playing here. I’ll pay you for your
			trouble. Play something short that will put the general in a good
			mood.Your instruments all have a nasal twang. Have they been to NaplesNaples was considered a likely place to contract syphilis, which eats away at the bridge of the nose.Naples?Excuse me?Are these wind instruments?Yes, they are.Oh, there’s the problem.What’s the problem?Anyone full of hot air is a problem. But here’s some
			money. The general likes your music a lot, but he asks you to stop
			playing now.Well, we’ll stop, then.
