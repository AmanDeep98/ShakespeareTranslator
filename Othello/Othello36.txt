More than pertains to feats of broils and battle,And therefore little shall I grace my causeIn speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,I will a round unvarnished tale deliverOf my whole course of love. What drugs, what charms,What conjuration and what mighty magic—For such proceeding I am charged withal—I won his daughter.    A maiden never
			bold,Of spirit so still and quiet that her motionBlushed at herself. And she, in spite of nature,Of years, of country, credit, everything,To fall in love with what she feared to look on?It is a judgment maimed and most imperfectThat will confess perfection so could err.Against all rules of nature, and must be drivenTo find out practices of cunning hellWhy this should be. I therefore vouch againThat with some mixtures powerful o'er the bloodOr with some dram, conjured to this effect,He wrought upon her.    To vouch this is
			no proof,Without more wider and more overt testThan these thin habits and poor likelihoodsOf modern seeming do prefer against him.But, Othello, speak.Did you by indirect and forcèd coursesSubdue and poison this young maid’s affections?Or came it by request and such fair questionAs soul to soul affordeth?    I do beseech you,Send for the lady to the Sagittary,#LBSFORGOLDstory of how we fell in love, and what drugs, charms, spells, and
			powerful magic—because that’s what
			I’m being accused of—I used to win his
			daughter.She’s a good girl, quiet and obedient. She blushes at
			the slightest thing. And you want me to believe that despite her
			young age and proper upbringing she fell in love with a man
			she’d be afraid to look at? The very thought of it is
			ridiculous. You’d have to be stupid to think that someone
			so perfect could make such an unnatural mistake as that. The devil
			must be behind this. Therefore I say again that he must have used
			some powerful drug or magic potion on her.Your saying this isn’t proof. There has to be clear
			evidence that he’s done this, not just these
		    accusations.Tell us, Othello. Did you trick or deceive this lady in some way?
			Or did you agree to this as equals?Please, send for Desdemona to come here from the Sagittarius Inn
			and ask her to speak about me in front
