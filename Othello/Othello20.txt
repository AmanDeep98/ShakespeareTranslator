Those are the raisèd father and his friends.You were best go in.    Not I, I must be
			found.My parts, my title, and my perfect soulShall manifest me rightly. Is it they?By Janus, I think no.The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant?The goodness of the night upon you, friends!What is the news?    The Duke does
			greet you, general,And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,Even on the instant.    What’s
			the matter, think you?Something from Cyprus as I may divine.It is a business of some heat. The galleysHave sent a dozen sequent messengersThis very night at one another’s heels,And many of the consuls, raised and met,Are at the Duke’s already. You have been hotly called
			for.When being not at your lodging to be foundThe Senate hath sent about three several guestsTo search you out.    'Tis
			well I am found by you.I will but spend a word here in the houseAnd go with you.#LBSFORGOLDThat’s her father and his friends, who’ve
			been roused out of bed. You’d better go inside.No, I must let them find me. My good qualities, my legal status as
			Desdemona’s husband, and my innocence will protect me. Is
			it them?I don’t think so.The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant? Hello, everyone!
			What’s going on?The Duke sends his regards. He needs to see you right away.What do you think he wants?Something about Cyprus. I think it’s important. The
			warships have sent a dozen messages tonight, one after the other,
			and many of the senators have been awakened and are at the
			Duke’s already. They’re very anxious for you
			to get there. When you weren’t at home, the Senate sent
			out three different search parties to find you.It’s good you found me. I’ll just speak a
			word or two here in the house and then I’ll go with
		    you.
