There’s no composition in this newsThat gives them credit.Indeed, they are disproportioned.My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.And mine a hundred and forty.    And mine, two
			hundred.But though they jump not on a just account—As in these cases, where the aim reports'Tis oft with difference—yet do they all
			confirmA Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.Nay, it is possible enough to judgment.I do not so secure me in the error,But the main article I do approveIn fearful sense.

    What, ho, what,
			ho, what, ho!A messenger from the galleys.Now, what’s the business?The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes,So was I bid report here to the stateBy Signior Angelo.#LBSFORGOLDThese reports are inconsistent. You can’t trust
		    them.It’s true, they’re inconsistent. My letters
			say there are a hundred and seven ships.And mine say a hundred and forty.And mine say two hundred. But often in these cases, reports are
			just estimates. The important thing is that they all say a Turkish
			fleet is approaching Cyprus.Yes, we get the idea. The inconsistency doesn’t make me
			think that the reports are all wrong. I have no doubt about what
			they’re basically saying, and it’s
			frightening.
(offstage) Hello! Hey,
		    hello!It’s a messenger from the warships.Why are you here?Signor Angelo told me to come here and tell you that the Turkish
			fleet is heading for Rhodes, not Cyprus.
