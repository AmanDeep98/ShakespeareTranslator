  Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio,My advocation is not now in tune.My lord is not my lord, nor should I know himWere he in favor as in humor altered.So help me every spirit sanctifiedAs I have spoken for you all my bestAnd stood within the blank of his displeasureFor my free speech. You must awhile be patient.What I can do I will, and more I willThan for myself I dare. Let that suffice you.Is my lord angry?  He went hence but now,And certainly in strange unquietness.Can he be angry? I have seen the cannonWhen it hath blown his ranks into the airAnd, like the devil, from his very armPuffed his own brother—and is he angry?Something of moment then, I will go meet him.There’s matter in ’t indeed, if he be
                            angry.I prithee, do so.  Something, sure, of state,Either from Venice, or some unhatched practiceMade demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,Hath puddled his clear spirit, and in such casesMen’s natures wrangle with inferior things,Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so,For let our finger ache and it enduesOur other healthful members even to that senseOf pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,Nor of them look for such observancesAs fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,Arraigning his unkindness with my soul,But now I find I had suborned the witness,And he’s indicted falsely.#LBSFORGOLDI’m sorry, dear Cassio, but now is not the right time
                                to bring up your case. My husband’s not himself. If his
                                face changed as much as his personality has, I wouldn’t
                                recognize him. God knows I have done my best to argue for you, and
                                made him angry at me for being so aggressive. You’ll just
                                have to be patient for a little while. I’ll do what I
                                can, more than I’d do for myself. Let that be enough for
                                you.Is Othello angry?He just left, clearly upset about something.Can he even get angry? It’s hard to believe.
                                I’ve seen him stay calm when cannons were blowing his
                                soldiers to bits, even killing his own brother without him batting
                                an eyelid—is he really upset? It must be about something
                                important. I’ll go talk to him. If he’s angry,
                                there must be something seriously wrong.Please, do so.There must be some political news from Venice, or some dangerous
                                plot here in Cyprus has ruined his good mood. Men always get angry
                                about little things when they’re really worried about
                                bigger ones. That’s the way it goes. When our finger
                                hurts, it makes the rest of the body hurt too. We
                                shouldn’t expect men to be perfect, or for them to be as
                                polite as on the weddingday. Oh, Emilia, I’m so
                                inexperienced that I thought he was being unkind, but actually I was
                                judging him harshly.
