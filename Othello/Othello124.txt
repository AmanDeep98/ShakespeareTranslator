I’ll send her to you presently,And I’ll devise a mean to draw the MoorOut of the way, that your converse and businessMay be more free.I humbly thank you for’t.I never knew a Florentine more kind and honest.Good morrow, good Lieutenant. I am sorryFor your displeasure, but all will sure be well.The general and his wife are talking of it,And she speaks for you stoutly. The Moor repliesThat he you hurt is of great fame in CyprusAnd great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdomHe might not but refuse you. But he protests he loves youAnd needs no other suitor but his likingsTo take the safest occasion by the frontTo bring you in again.    Yet I beseech you,If you think fit, or that it may be done,Give me advantage of some brief discourseWith Desdemona alone.    Pray you come in.I will bestow you where you shall have timeTo speak your bosom freely.    I am much bound to
                                you.#LBSFORGOLDI’ll send her out to you now. I’ll think of
                                a plan to get the Moor out of the way, so you can speak more
                            openly.I humbly thank you.Even for a FlorentineThe citizens of Florence (who included Machiavelli) were not known for kindness and honesty, but Michael Cassio seems unaware of Florence’s bad reputation.Florentine, I never knew someone so kind and honest.Good morning, lieutenant. I’m sorry about what
                                happened, but I’m sure everything will turn out all
                                right. The general and his wife are talking about it now, and
                                she’s defending you strongly. The Moor says the man you
                                hurt is very important in Cyprus, and that under the circumstances
                                he has no choice but to refuse to reinstate you. But he says he
                                still loves and respects you, and based on his own feelings alone
                                he’s looking for an opportunity to safely take you
                            back.Please find a way to give me some time alone with Desdemona, if
                                you think that’s all right.Please come in. I’ll take you to a place where you can
                                speak freely.Thank you very much.
