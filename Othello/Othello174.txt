Much castigation, exercise devout,For here’s a young and sweating devil here,That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,A frank one.  You may indeed say so,For ’twas that hand that gave away my heart.A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands,But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.What promise, chuck?I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me.Lend me thy handkerchief.    Here, my
                            lord.That which I gave you.    I have it not
                                about me.Not? No, indeed, my lord.    That’s
                                a fault. That handkerchiefDid an Egyptian to my mother give,She was a charmer and could almost read#LBSFORGOLDfast and pray to stave off temptations. Someone with a young

                                in marriage. But these days, people give each other their hands
                                without their hearts.I don’t know about that. Now, don’t forget,
                                you promised me something.What did I promise, my dear?I sent for Cassio to come talk with you.I have a bad cold that’s bothering me. Lend me your
