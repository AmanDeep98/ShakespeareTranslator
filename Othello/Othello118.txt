    Two things are to
			be done:My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress.I’ll set her on.Myself, the while, to draw the Moor apartAnd bring him jump when he may Cassio findSoliciting his wife. Ay, that’s the way.Dull not device by coldness and delay.#LBSFORGOLDNow two things still need to be done. My wife has to help make
			Desdemona take Cassio’s side. I’ll put her on
			that. And I need to take the Moor aside right at the moment when
			Cassio’s talking to Desdemona, so he’ll see
			them together. Yes, that’s the way I’ll do it.
			Let’s not ruin a brilliant plan by being slow to
		    act.
