Sir, would she give you so much of her lipsAs of her tongue she oft bestows on me,You’ll have enough.Alas, she has no speech!In faith, too much.I find it still, when I have leave to sleep.Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,She puts her tongue a little in her heartAnd chides with thinking.    You have little
			cause to say so.Come on, come on. You are pictures out of door, bells in your
			parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens, saints in your injuries, devils
			being offended, players in your housewifery, and housewives in your
			beds.Oh, fie upon thee, slanderer!Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk.You rise to play and go to bed to work.You shall not write my praise.    No, let me
		    not.What wouldst thou write of me, if thou should’st praise
			me?#LBSFORGOLDIf she gave you as much lip as she gives me, you’d be
			sick of her by now.On the contrary, she’s a soft-spoken woman.No, she talks too much. She’s always talking when I
			want to sleep. I admit that in front of you, my lady, she keeps a
			bit quiet. But she’s scolding me silently.You have no reason to say that.Come on, come on. You women are all the same. You’re as
			pretty as pictures when you’re out in public, but in your
			own houses you’re as noisy as jangling bells. In your own
			kitchens you act like wildcats. You make yourselves sound like
			saints when you’re complaining about something, but you
			act like devils when someone offends you. You don’t take
			your jobs as housewives seriously, and you’re shameless
			hussies in bed.Shame on you, you slanderer!No, it’s true, or if it’s not,
			I’m a villain. You wake up to have fun, and you start
			work when you go to bed.You clearly have nothing good to say about me.No, I don’t.But if you had to say something nice about me, what would you
		    say?
