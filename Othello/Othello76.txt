			’tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers to your lips?
			Would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!—The Moor! I know his trumpet.    'Tis

		    Othello!It gives me wonder great as my contentTo see you here before me. Oh, my soul’s joy!If after every tempest come such calms,May the winds blow till they have wakened death,And let the laboring bark climb hills of seasOlympus-high, and duck again as lowAs hell’s from heaven! If it were now to die,'Twere now to be most happy, for I fearMy soul hath her content so absoluteThat not another comfort like to thisSucceeds in unknown fate.    The heavens
		    forbidBut that our loves and comforts should increase,Even as our days do grow.#LBSFORGOLDIf you lose your job

			you’re kissingA gentleman’s kissing his own fingers was considered a polite gesture.kissing your own hand, one finger at a time? I wish those fingers
			were enema tubes!—That’s the Moor! I recognize his trumpet.Yes, it is.Let’s go greet him when he lands.Look, here he comes.My beautiful warrior!My darling Othello!I’m amazed you got here before me. But I’m
			overjoyed! My love, if the calm after the storm could always be this
			wonderful, I’d want the wind to blow until it waked the
			dead, and whipped up waves as tall as mountains! If I died right now
			I’d be completely happy, since I’ll probably
			never be as happy as this again in my life.God willing, our love and our happiness will only increase as we
			get older.
