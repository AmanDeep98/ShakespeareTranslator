You advise me well.I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.I think it freely, and betimes in the morning I will beseech the

		    watch.Good night, honest Iago.And what’s he then that says I play the villain?When this advice is free I give and honest,Probal to thinking and indeed the courseTo win the Moor again? For ’tis most easyTh' inclining Desdemona to subdueIn any honest suit. She’s framed as fruitfulAs the free elements.
