Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isleThat so approve the Moor. Oh, let the heavensGive him defense against the elements,For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.Is he well shipped?His bark is stoutly timbered and his pilotOf very expert and approved allowanceTherefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,Stand in bold cure.
(within) A sail, a sail, a
		    sail!What noise?The town is empty. On the brow o' th' seaStand ranks of people, and they cry “A
			sail!”My hopes do shape him for the governor.They do discharge their shot of courtesy.Our friends at least.I pray you sir, go forthAnd give us truth who ’tis that is arrived.I shall.#LBSFORGOLDThanks, you brave men who defend this island and respect Othello.
			I hope heaven protects him from the weather, because I lost sight of
			him on the stormy sea.Is his ship sturdy?Yes, it’s well built, and the ship’s pilot
			is very expert and experienced. For that reason I still have some
			hope for him, even though I don’t have my hopes up too
			high.
(offstage) A sail! A sail! A
		    sail!What’s all that shouting about?Everybody in town is down at the shore shouting “A
			sail!”I hope it’s Othello.They’ve fired a greeting shot, so at least
			it’s a friendly ship.Please go find out for certain who has arrived.I’ll do that.
