Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonightI do entreat that we may sup together.You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus. Goats and monkeys!Is this the noble Moor whom our full senateCall all in all sufficient? Is this the natureWhom passion could not shake? Whose solid virtueThe shot of accident nor dart of chanceCould neither graze nor pierce?    He is much
                                changed.Are his wits safe? Is he not light of brain?He’s that he is. I may not breathe my censureWhat he might be. If what he might he is not,I would to heaven he were!    What? Strike his
                                wife?'Faith, that was not so well. Yet would I knewThat stroke would prove the worst!    Is it his use?Or did the letters work upon his bloodAnd new-create his fault?#LBSFORGOLDCassio can have my job. And tonight, sir, I invite you have dinner
                                with me. Welcome to Cyprus. Horny animals!Is this the same Moor whom the senate considers so capable? Is
                                this the guy who’s supposed to never get emotional, and
                                who never gets rattled, no matter what disaster happens?He’s changed a great deal.Is he sane? Is he losing his mind?He is what he is. I won’t say anything negative about
                                what he might be. If he isn’t what he might be, then I
                                wish to God he were!Hitting his wife?It’s true, that wasn’t such a nice thing to
                                do. But I wish I could say that’s the last time
                                he’ll do it!Is it a habit of his? Or did the letter make him emotional
                                somehow, and this is the first time he’s done it?
