That Cassio loves her, I do well believe ’t.That she loves him, ’tis apt and of great credit.The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,And I dare think he’ll prove to DesdemonaA most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,Not out of absolute lust—though peradventureI stand accountant for as great a sin—But partly led to diet my revenge,For that I do suspect the lusty MoorHath leaped into my seat. The thought whereofDoth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards,And nothing can or shall content my soulTill I am evened with him, wife for wife.Or, failing so, yet that I put the MoorAt least into a jealousy so strongThat judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,If this poor trash of Venice, whom I traceFor his quick hunting, stand the putting on,I’ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,Abuse him to the Moor in the right garb(For I fear Cassio with my night-cape too)Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward meFor making him egregiously an assAnd practicing upon his peace and quietEven to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused.Knavery’s plain face is never seen till used.#LBSFORGOLDI think Cassio really does love her, and it’s perfectly
			likely that she loves him too. I can’t stand the Moor,
			but I have to admit that he’s a reliable, loving, and
			good-natured man. He’d probably be a good husband to
			Desdemona. I love her too, not simply out of lust, but also to feed
			my revenge. I have a feeling the Moor slept with my wife. That
			thought keeps gnawing at me, eating me up inside. I won’t
			be satisfied until I get even with him, wife for wife. If I
			can’t do that, I can at least make the Moor so jealous
			that he can’t think straight. If that piece of Venetian
			trash Roderigo can do what I need to carry out my plan,
			I’ll have power over Cassio. I’ll say bad
			things about him to the Moor. I have a feeling Cassio seduced my
			wife as well. I’ll make the Moor thank me, love me, and
			reward me, even though the joke will be on him the whole time.
			I’ve got a good plan, though I haven’t worked
			out the details yet. You can never see the end of an evil plan until
			the moment comes.
