Tush! Never tell me. I take it much unkindlyThat thou, Iago, who hast had my purseAs if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.'Sblood, but you’ll not hear me! If ever I
			did dream of such a matter, abhor me.Thou told’st meThou didst hold him in thy hate.Despise meIf I do not. Three great ones of the city(In personal suit to make me his lieutenant)Off-capped to him, and by the faith of manI know my price, I am worth no worse a place.But he (as loving his own pride and purposes)Evades them with a bombast circumstanceHorribly stuffed with epithets of war,And in conclusionNonsuits my mediators. For “Certes,” says
			he,“I have already chose my officer.”And what was he?Forsooth, a great arithmetician,One Michael Cassio, a Florentine(A fellow almost damned in a fair wife)That never set a squadron in the field,Nor the division of a battle knowsMore than a spinster—unless the bookish theoric,#LBSFORGOLDCome on, don’t tell me that. I don’t like it

			have things his own way, so he sidesteps the issue with a lot of
			military talk and refuses their request. “I’ve
			already chosen my lieutenant,” he says. And who does he
			choose? A guy who knows more about numbers than fighting! This guy
			from Florence named Michael Cassio. He has a pretty wife but he
			can’t even control her. And he’s definitely
			never commanded men in battle. He’s got no more hands-on
			knowledge of warfare than an old woman—unless you count
			what he’s read in books,
