If I can fasten but one cup upon him,With that which he hath drunk tonight already,He’ll be as full of quarrel and offenseAs my young mistress' dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,Whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out,To Desdemona hath tonight carousedPotations pottle-deep, and he’s to watch.Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits(That hold their honors in a wary distance,The very elements of this warlike isle)Have I tonight flustered with flowing cups,And they watch too. Now ’mongst this flock of drunkardsAm I to put our Cassio in some actionThat may offend the isle.    But here they
			come.If consequence do but approve my dreamMy boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.'Fore heaven, they have given me a rouse
		    already.Good faith, a little one, not past a pint, As I am a
		    soldier.    Some wine, ho!
(sings)

 And let me the
			    cannikin clink, clink,

 And let me the
			    cannikin clink.

 A
			    soldier’s a man,

 A life’s
			    but a span,

 Why then let a
			    soldier drink.

 Some wine,
			boys!
#LBSFORGOLDIf I can just get him to drink one more glass after what
			he’s drunk already, he’ll be as argumentative
			and eager to fight as a little dog. That fool Roderigo, all twisted
			up inside with love, has been drinking toasts to Desdemona by the
			gallon, and he’s on guard duty.I’ve gotten the
			rest of the guards drunk, as well as several gentlemen from Cyprus
			who are quick to take offense. Now I’ll get Cassio to do
			something in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone
			on the island. Here they come. If the future turns out as I hope it
			will, I’m all set for success.My God, they’ve given me a lot to drink.No, it was a little one, not more than a pint.Bring in more wine!
(he sings)

 And clink your
			    glasses together,
 And clink your
			    glasses together.
 A
			    soldier’s a man,
 And a
			    man’s life is short,
 So let the soldier
			    drink.
 Have some more
			    wine, boys!
