And let her speak of me before her father.If you do find me foul in her reportThe trust, the office I do hold of you,Not only take away, but let your sentenceEven fall upon my life.    Fetch Desdemona
			hither.Ancient, conduct them. You best know the place.And till she come, as truly as to heavenI do confess the vices of my bloodSo justly to your grave ears I’ll presentHow I did thrive in this fair lady’s loveAnd she in mine.    Say it,
		    Othello.Her father loved me, oft invited me,Still questioned me the story of my lifeFrom year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,That I have passed.I ran it through, even from my boyish days,To th' very moment that he bade me tell it,Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances,Of moving accidents by flood and field,Of hair-breadth ’scapes i' th'
			imminent deadly breach,Of being taken by the insolent foeAnd sold to slavery, of my redemption thenceAnd portance in my traveler’s history.Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,Rough quarries, rocks, hills whose heads touch heavenIt was my hint to speak—such was my process—And of the Cannibals that each others eat,#LBSFORGOLDof her father. If she has anything bad to say about me, then you
			can sentence me to death.Bring Desdemona here.Iago, bring Desdemona here. You know where she is.In the meantime I’ll tell you all, as honestly as I
			confess my sins to God, how I wooed this beautiful lady, and how she
			came to love me.Tell us, Othello.Her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often,
			continually asking me about my life and all the battles
			I’ve fought. I told him everything, from my boyhood up
			until the time when I was talking to him. I told him about
			unfortunate disasters, hair-raising adventures on sea and on land,
			and near-catastrophes and dangerous adventures I’ve been
			through. I told him how I was captured and sold as a slave, how I
			bought my freedom, and how I wandered through caves and deserts. I
			was able to tell him about cannibals who eat each other, and men
			with heads growing below their shoulders. When I talked about all
			these things, Desdemona used to listen attentively. If she had to go
			do some household chore, I noticed that she’d always come
			back quickly to hear more of my stories.
