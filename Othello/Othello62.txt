			put in,A Veronesa. Michael Cassio,Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,Is come on shore. The Moor himself at seaAnd is in full commission here for Cyprus.I am glad on ’t. 'Tis a worthy
		    governor.But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfortTouching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadlyAnd prays the Moor be safe. For they were partedWith foul and violent tempest.     Pray
			heavens he be,For I have served him, and the man commandsLike a full soldier. Let’s to the seaside, ho!As well to see the vessel that’s come inAs to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,Even till we make the main and th' aerial blueAn indistinct regard.    Come,
			let’s do so.For every minute is expectancyOf more arrivance.#LBSFORGOLDI’ve got news, boys, the war’s over! This
			terrible storm has smashed the Turks so badly that their plans are
			ruined. One of our ships has reported that it saw most of their
			fleet shipwrecked.What? Is this true?The ship’s sailing into harbor now; it’s
			from Verona. Michael Cassio, lieutenant of the Moor Othello, has
			arrived on shore. The Moor himself is still at sea. He’s
			been commissioned to come here to Cyprus.I’m happy about that. He’ll be a good
			governor.Cassio brings good news about the Turkish defeat, but
			he’s worried about the Othello’s safety. The
			two of them were separated during the storm.I hope to God Othello’s all right. I served under him,
			and I know what an excellent commander he is. Let’s go to
			the shore to get a look at the ship that came in, and to look out
			for Othello’s ship. We’ll stare out at the sea
			until the sea and the sky blur together.Let’s do that. Every minute we expect more ships to
			arrive.
