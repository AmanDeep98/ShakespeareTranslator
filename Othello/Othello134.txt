Why, then, tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn.On Tuesday noon, or night, or Wednesday morn.I prithee name the time, but let it notExceed three days. In faith, he’s penitent,And yet his trespass, in our common reason(Save that, they say, the wars must make exampleOut of her best) is not, almost, a faultT' incur a private check. When shall he come?Tell me, Othello. I wonder in my soulWhat you would ask me that I should denyOr stand so mamm'ring on. What? Michael CassioThat came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,Hath ta'en your part, to have so much to doTo bring him in? Trust me, I could do much—Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will,I will deny thee nothing.    Why, this is not a
                                boon,'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,Or sue to you to do a peculiar profitTo your own person. Nay, when I have a suitWherein I mean to touch your love indeedIt shall be full of poise and difficult weightAnd fearful to be granted.    I will deny thee
                                nothing!Whereon I do beseech thee, grant me this,To leave me but a little to myself.Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.Farewell, my Desdemona. I’ll come to thee
                            straight.#LBSFORGOLDWell then, tomorrow night, or Tuesday morning. Or Tuesday noon or
                                at night, or Wednesday morning. Please just name a time, but
                                don’t wait more than three days. He’s very
                                sorry. His mistake was hardly worth punishing him for in the first
                                place—though in wartime it is sometimes necessary to make
                                examples out of even the best soldiers. So when should he come? Tell
                                me, Othello. I can’t imagine you asking me for something
                                and me telling you no or standing there muttering. Michael Cassio
                                came with you when you were trying to win my love. Sometimes
                                I’d criticize you to him, and he’d defend you.
                                And now I have to make this big fuss about bringing him back? I
                                swear, I could do so much—Please, no more. He can come whenever he wants. I won’t
                                refuse you anything.Don’t act like you’re doing me a favor! This
                                is like if I asked you to wear your gloves when it’s cold
                                outside, or eat nutritious food, or do something that’s
                                good for you. If I ever have to ask you for something that will put
                                your luck to the test, it’ll be something difficult and
                                terrible.I won’t deny you anything! But in return, please, do
                                one thing for me: leave me alone for a little while.Would I ever deny you anything? No. Goodbye, my husband.Goodbye, my Desdemona. I’ll come see you right
                            away.
