Her honor is an essence that’s not seen,They have it very oft that have it not.But for the handkerchief—By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.Thou saidst—Oh, it comes o'er my memory,As doth the raven o'er the infectious house,Boding to all—he had my handkerchief.Ay, what of that?  That’s not so good now.What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong?Or heard him say—as knaves be such abroad,Who having, by their own importunate suit,Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,Convincèd or supplied them, cannot chooseBut they must blab—    Hath he said any
                                thing?He hath, my lord, but be you well assuredNo more than he’ll unswear.    What hath he
                            said?Why, that he did—I know not what he did.What? what?  Lie—  With her?#LBSFORGOLDYou can’t see a reputation. A lot of people
                                don’t even deserve the reputations they have. But a
                                handkerchief—God, I wish I could forget about the handkerchief! What you told
                                me it haunts me like a nightmare—he’s got my
                                handkerchief!Yes, what about it?That’s not good.What if I’d said I saw him do something to hurt you? Or
                                heard him say something about it. You know there are jerks out there
                                who have to brag about bedding some woman.—Has he said anything?Yes, but he’d deny it all.What did he say?He said he did—I don’t know.He what?He was in bed with—With her?
