                                a change indeed!'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.How have I been behaved that he might stickThe small’st opinion on my least misuse?What is your pleasure, madam? How is ’t with
                            you?I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babesDo it with gentle means and easy tasks.He might have chid me so, for, in good faith,I am a child to chiding.    What is the

                                Emilia. I can’t even cry, though tears are the only
                                answers I could give to all your questions. Tonight put my wedding
