  A good wench, give it me.What will you do with ’t, that you have been so earnestTo have me filch it?  Why, what is that to you?If it be not for some purpose of import,Give ’t me again. Poor lady, she’ll run madWhen she shall lack it.Be not acknown on ’t,I have use for it. Go, leave me.I will in Cassio’s lodging lose this napkinAnd let him find it. Trifles light as airAre to the jealous confirmations strongAs proofs of holy writ. This may do something.The Moor already changes with my poison.Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisonsWhich at the first are scarce found to distaste,But with a little act upon the bloodBurn like the mines of sulfur.    I did say so.Look, where he comes. Not poppy nor mandragoraNor all the drowsy syrups of the world,Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleepWhich thou owedst yesterday.    Ha! Ha! False to
                                me?Why, how now, general? No more of that.#LBSFORGOLDGood girl, give it to me.And what are you going to do with it? Why did you want it so much
                                that you begged me to steal it?What’s it to you?If you don’t need it for some important reason, then
                                give it back to me. Poor lady, she’ll go crazy when she
                                sees it’s missing.Don’t admit to knowing anything about it. I need it.
                                Now go, leave me.I’ll leave this handkerchief at Cassio’s
                                house and let him find it.To a jealous man, a meaningless little
                                thing like this looks like absolute proof. This handkerchief may be
                                useful to me. The Moor’s mind has already become infected
                                with my poisonous suggestions. Ideas can be like poisons. At first
                                they hardly even taste bad, but once they get into your blood they
                                start burning like hot lava.Here he comes. No drugs or sleeping pills will ever give you the
                                restful sleep that you had last night.Argh! She’s cheating on me?Oh, general, please, no more of that!
