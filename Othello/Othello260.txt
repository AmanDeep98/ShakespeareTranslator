                                the matter?
(to LODOVICO) This is Othello’s ancient, as I take
                            it.The same indeed, a very valiant fellow.
(to CASSIO) What are you here that cry so grievously?Iago? Oh, I am spoiled, undone by villains!Give me some help.Oh, me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?I think that one of them is hereabout,And cannot make away.  Oh, treacherous villains!—
(to LODOVICO and GRATIANO)

                            villain!#LBSFORGOLDWe don’t know.Didn’t you hear someone shouting?I’m here, here! For heaven’s sake, help
