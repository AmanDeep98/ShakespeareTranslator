You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.Good signior, you shall more command with yearsThan with your weapons.O thou foul thief, where hast thou stowed my daughter?Damned as thou art, thou hast enchanted her!For I’ll refer me to all things of sense,If she in chains of magic were not bound,Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,So opposite to marriage that she shunnedThe wealthy curlèd darlings of our nation,Would ever have, t' incur a general mock,Run from her guardage to the sooty bosomOf such a thing as thou—to fear, not to delight.Judge me the world if ’tis not gross in senseThat thou hast practiced on her with foul charms,Abused her delicate youth with drugs or mineralsThat weakens motion. I’ll have ’t disputed
			on.'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.I therefore apprehend and do attach theeFor an abuser of the world, a practicerOf arts inhibited and out of warrant.—Lay hold upon him. If he do resist,Subdue him at his peril!    Hold your hands,Both you of my inclining and the rest.Were it my cue to fight, I should have known itWithout a prompter. Whither will you that I goTo answer this your charge?#LBSFORGOLDYou, Roderigo! Come on, I’ll fight you.Put away your swords. They’ll get rusty in the dew.
			Sir, your age and status inspire more respect than your weapons
		    do.You evil thief, where have you hidden my daughter? You devil,
			you’ve put a spell on her! Anybody with eyes could tell
			you that a beautiful and happy young girl like her, who’s
			refused to marry all of the handsome young men of the city,
			wouldn’t run off with a black thing like you unless
			she’d been bewitched. You’re something to
			fear, not to love. It’s obvious to everyone that
			you’ve tricked her, drugged her, or kidnapped her.
			That’s probably what happened, so I’m
			arresting you.—Arrest this man as a practitioner of black
			magic. Grab him. If he struggles, use force!Just a minute. I don’t need anyone to tell me when to
			fight. You’ve accused me of some serious crimes. Where do
			you want me to go to respond to these charges?
