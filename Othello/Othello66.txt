But good lieutenant, is your general wived?Most fortunately. He hath achieved a maidThat paragons description and wild fame,One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,And in th' essential vesture of creationDoes tire the ingener.How now? Who has put in?'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.He’s had most favorable and happy speed.Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,The guttered rocks and congregated sands,Traitors ensteeped to enclog the guiltless keel,As having sense of beauty, do omitTheir mortal natures, letting go safely byThe divine Desdemona.What is she?She that I spake of, our great captain’s captain,Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,Whose footing here anticipates our thoughtsA se'nnight’s speed. Great Jove, Othello
			guard,And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,Make love’s quick pants in Desdemona’s arms,Give renewed fire to our extincted spiritsAnd bring all Cyprus comfort!#LBSFORGOLDGood lieutenant, is your general married?Yes, and he’s very lucky to have married the woman he
			did. His wife defies description. She’s God’s
			masterpiece, and she’d exhaust whoever tried to do her
			justice while praising her.Who’s arrived in the harbor?A man named Iago, the general’s ensign.He made good time. You see how the storm, the jagged rocks, and
			the sand banks that trap ships all appreciate a beautiful woman.
			They let the heavenly Desdemona arrive safe and sound.Who’s that?She’s the one I was talking about, the
			general’s wife. The brave Iago was put in charge of
			bringing her here, and he’s arrived a week sooner than we
			expected. Dear God, please protect Othello and help him arrive here
			safely, so he and Desdemona can be in each other’s arms,
			and Othello can cheer us up and bring comfort to Cyprus.
