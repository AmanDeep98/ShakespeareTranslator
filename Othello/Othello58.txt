			How? How? Let’s see. After a while I’ll start
			telling Othello that Cassio is too intimate with Desdemona. Cassio
			is a smooth talker and a good-looking guy, the sort of man that
			people would expect to be a seducer. The Moor is open and
			straightforward. He thinks any man who seems honest is honest.
			People like that are easy to manipulate. So it’s all
			decided. I’ve worked it out. With a little help from the
			devil, I’ll bring this monstrous plan to success.
