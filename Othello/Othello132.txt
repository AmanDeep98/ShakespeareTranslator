    How now, my lord?I have been talking with a suitor here,A man that languishes in your displeasure.Who is ’t you mean?Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,If I have any grace or power to move youHis present reconciliation take.For if he be not one that truly loves you,That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,I have no judgment in an honest face.I prithee, call him back.Went he hence now?Ay, sooth, so humbledThat he hath left part of his grief with meTo suffer with him. Good love, call him back.Not now, sweet Desdemona. Some other time.But shall ’t be shortly?    The sooner, sweet,
                                for you.Shall ’t be tonight at supper?    No, not
                            tonight.Tomorrow dinner, then?    I shall not dine
                                at home,I meet the captains at the citadel.#LBSFORGOLDWhat’s this, my lord? I was talking to a petitioner
                                here just now, someone who’s suffering from your
                            anger.Who do you mean?Your lieutenant, Cassio. Oh, if I’ve got any influence
                                over you at all, please patch things up with him. In my judgment,
                                this man truly loves you, and his mistake was innocent rather than
                                wicked. Please call him and tell him to come back here.Was that him just now?Yes. He feels so bad and humble that I feel bad along with him. My
                                love, call him back in here.Not now, my sweet Desdemona. Some other time.But will it be soon?Very soon, because you want it.Will it be tonight at supper?No, not tonight.Then tomorrow at dinner?I won’t be eating dinner at home. I’ll be
                                meeting the captains at the citadel.
