What from the cape can you discern at sea?Nothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood.I cannot ’twixt the heaven and the mainDescry a sail.Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land,A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements.If it hath ruffianed so upon the seaWhat ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?A segregation of the Turkish fleet.For do but stand upon the foaming shore,The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds,The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,Seems to cast water on the burning bear,And quench the guards of th' ever-fixèd
			pole.I never did like molestation viewOn the enchafèd flood.If that the Turkish fleetBe not ensheltered and embayed, they are drowned.It is impossible they bear it out.#LBSFORGOLDWhat can you see out on the ocean?Nothing. The water’s so rough that I can’t
			see any sails, either in the bay or on the ocean.It was windy on shore too. A big blast of wind shook our
			fortifications. How could a ship made out of wood hold together in
			those mountainous waves? What do you think will be the result of
			this storm?The Turkish navy will be broken up. The wind’s whipping
			up the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash
			against the stars in the sky. I’ve never seen the waters
			so disturbed.If the Turkish fleet isn’t protected in some harbor,
			their men must all be drowned. No ship could survive this
		    storm.
