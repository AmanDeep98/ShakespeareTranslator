 The poor soul sat sighing by a
                                    sycamore tree,
 Sing all a green
                                willow.
 Her hand on her bosom, her head
                                    on her knee,
 Sing willow, willow,
                                willow.
 The fresh streams ran by her,
                                    and murmured her moans,
 Sing willow, willow,
                                willow.
 Her salt tears fell from her,
                                    and softened the stones
 Sing willow, willow,
                                    willow—
 Lay by
                                these—
    Willow, willow—
 Prithee, hie thee,
                                    he’ll come anon—
 Sing all a green willow must be
                                    my garland.
 Let nobody blame him, his scorn
                                    I approve—
Nay, that’s not next—Hark! Who is
                                ’t that knocks?It’s the wind.
(sings)

I called my love false love but what said he
                                    then?
  Sing willow,
                                    willow, willow.
If I court more women you’ll couch with more
                                men—So, get thee gone, good night. Mine eyes do itch,Doth that bode weeping?    'Tis
                                neither here nor there.I have heard it said so. Oh, these men, these men!Dost thou in conscience think—tell me,
                                Emilia—That there be women do abuse their husbandsIn such gross kind?    There be some
                                such, no question.#LBSFORGOLD

 The poor soul sat singing by
                                    the sycamore tree, Everyone sing the green
                                willow, She had her hand on her breast
                                    and her head on her knee, Sing willow, willow,
                                willow. The fresh streams ran by her
                                    and murmured her moans, Sing willow, willow,
                                willow. Her salt tears fell from her
                                    and softened the stones, Sing willow, willow,
                                willow.— Put these things over
                                there.— Please, hurry, he’ll

(singing) I told my lover he
                                    didn’t love me, but what did he say? Sing willow,
                                    willow, willow.If I chase more women, you’ll sleep with more
                                men—Okay, go away now. Good night. My eyes
                                itch—is that an omen I’ll be crying
                            soon?No, it doesn’t mean anything.I heard someone say that’s what it means. Oh, these
                                men, these men! Do you honestly think—tell me,
                                Emilia—there are women who’d cheat on their
                                husbands in such a disgusting manner?There are women like that out there, no question.
