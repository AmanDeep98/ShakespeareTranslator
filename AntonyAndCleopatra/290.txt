My sword is drawn.                                                                      Then
                                let it do at onceThe thing why thou hast drawn it.                                                                  My
                                dear master,My captain, and my emperor, let me say,Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.’Tis said, man, and farewell.Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?                                                                             Now,
                                Eros.Why, there then!                                     Thus I do escape the
                                sorrowOf Antony’s death.                                         Thrice nobler than
                                myself,Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, whatI should and thou couldst not. My Queen and ErosHave by their brave instruction got upon meA nobleness in record. But I will beA bridegroom in my death, and run into ’tAs to a lover’s bed. Come then, and Eros,Thy master dies thy scholar. To do thusI learned of thee.#LBSFORGOLDI have drawn my sword.Now let it carry out its purpose immediately. My dear master, my captain, my sovereign, let me say before I
                                strike this fatal blow: farewell. You’ve said it, friend, and farewell to you.Good-bye, great commander. Should I do it now?Now, Eros.Well, then, there!With this I avoid the grief of Antony’s death. Brave Eros, three times more honorable than I am! You teach me
                                what I should do but could not. My Queen and Eros have by their
                                brave examples beaten me to the history books. But I will embrace
                                death as a bridegroom does his bride, and rush to it as to a lover’s
                                bed. Come then. Eros, your master dies your student. I learned to do
                                this from you.
