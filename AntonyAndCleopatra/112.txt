We’ll meet you at
                                sea. You know that on land our army is far greater than
                                yours.Yes, on land you do outnumber me. Even more since you annexed my
                                father’s house and lands. But since, like the cuckooCuckoo birds lay their eggs in other birds’ nests.like the cuckoo, you don’t

                                must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to Rome. If
                                I agree to this, we may leave unharmed, with our shields undented.
