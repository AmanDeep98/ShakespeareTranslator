Hark. The land bids me tread no more upon ’t.It is ashamed to bear me. Friends, come hither.I am so lated in the world that IHave lost my way forever. I have a shipLaden with gold. Take that, divide it. FlyAnd make your peace with Caesar.                                                                    Fly?
                                Not we.I have fled myself, and have instructed cowardsTo run and show their shoulders. Friends, begone.I have myself resolved upon a courseWhich has no need of you. Begone.My treasure’s in the harbor. Take it. Oh,I followed that I blush to look upon!My very hairs do mutiny, for the whiteReprove the brown for rashness, and they themFor fear and doting. Friends, begone. You
                                shallHave letters from me to some friends that willSweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,Nor make replies of loathness. Take the hintWhich my despair proclaims. Let that be leftWhich leaves itself. To the seaside
                                straightway!I will possess you of that ship and treasure.Leave me, I pray, a little. Pray you now,Nay, do so, for indeed I have lost command.Therefore I pray you. I’ll see you by and by.#LBSFORGOLDListen. The earth tells me to stop walking upon it, as it’s
                                ashamed to carry me. Friends, come here. I’m completely lost. I have
                                a ship full of treasure. Take that. Divide it. Escape and make peace
                                with Caesar. Flee? Not us.I have already fled from my true self. I’ve told cowards to turn
                                their backs on me and run. Friends, go. I’ve decided on a plan that
                                doesn’t require your assistance. Leave. My treasure’s in the harbor;
                                take it. Oh, I followed something I’m ashamed to look at now! Even
                                my hair revolts. The white hairs blame the brown hairs for being
                                irresponsible, and the brown ones blame the white ones for being
                                spineless and foolish. Friends, go. I’ll give you letters of
                                introduction to some friends of mine who will help you. Please,
                                don’t be sad, and don’t tell me how reluctant you are. Take your
                                cues from my own despair. Abandon the person that has abandoned
                                himself. Go to the harbor immediately! I’ll give you the title to
                                that ship and its treasure. Just give me a moment, please—only a
                                moment. I’ve relinquished my authority, so please—I’ll see you all
                                before long.
