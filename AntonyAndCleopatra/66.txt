My being in Egypt, Caesar, what was ’t to you?No more than my residing here at RomeMight be to you in Egypt. Yet if you thereDid practice on my state, your being in EgyptMight be my question.                                             How intend you,
                                “practiced”?You may be pleased to catch at mine intentBy what did here befall me. Your wife and brotherMade wars upon me, and their contestationWas theme for you. You were the word of war.You do mistake your business. My brother neverDid urge me in his act. I did inquire it,And have my learning from some true reportsThat drew their swords with you. Did he not ratherDiscredit my authority with yours,And make the wars alike against my stomach,Having alike your cause? Of this my lettersBefore did satisfy you. If you’ll patch a quarrel,As matter whole you have to make it with,It must not be with this.                                               You praise
                                yourselfBy laying defects of judgment to me, butYou patched up your excuses.#LBSFORGOLDCaesar, what did my stay in Egypt have to do with you?No more than my staying here in Rome might mean to you in Egypt.
                                But if you conspired against my position while you were there, I
                                might be interested in the reason for your stay in Egypt.How do you mean, “conspired”?You can judge for yourself what I mean. Your wife and brother led
                                troops against me, claiming to be fighting in your name. They said
                                they were acting for you. You’re mistaken. My brother didn’t use my name to justify his
                                rebellion. I talked to some reliable participants in that battle. On
                                the contrary, his fight was with both of us. He rejected my
                                authority as much as yours. Since you and I share a common cause,
                                wouldn’t his actions against you be hostile to me as well? I’ve
                                already sent the proof in my letters. If you want to pick a fight,
                                you’ll have to find a more substantial excuse.You defend yourself by blaming my judgment, but you’re just making
                                up feeble excuses.
