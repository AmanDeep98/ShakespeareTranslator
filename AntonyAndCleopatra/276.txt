O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more.Fortune and Antony part here. Even hereDo we shake hands. All come to this? The
                                heartsThat spanieled me at heels, to whom I gaveTheir wishes, do discandy, melt their sweetsOn blossoming Caesar, and this pine is barkedThat overtopped them all. Betrayed I am.Oh, this false soul of Egypt! This grave
                                charm,Whose eye becked forth my wars and called them home,Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,Like a right gypsy hath at fast and looseBeguiled me to the very heart of loss.
(calling
                                    out) What, Eros, Eros!                                                             Ah,
                                thou spell! Avaunt!Why is my lord enraged against his love?Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving,And blemish Caesar’s triumph. Let him take theeAnd hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians!Follow his chariot, like the greatest spotOf all thy sex. Most monsterlike be shownFor poor’st diminutives, for dolts, and letPatient Octavia plow thy visage upWith her preparèd nails!#LBSFORGOLDOh, sun, I will never see another one of your sunrises. Luck and
                                Antony separate here and now. Here we’ll shake hands good-bye. Is it
                                all come to this? The brave men who followed me like little dogs,
                                whom I rewarded, have left me to follow Caesar. I’ve been stripped
                                of everything, betrayed. Oh, that devious Egyptian spirit! Her
                                charms launched my wars and called them back again. Pleasing her was
                                my main goal, and she lured me to total defeat. (calling out) Where
                                are you, Eros! Eros!Ah, you sorceress! Be gone!Why is my lord enraged against his love?Get out of my sight, or I’ll give you what you deserve and spoil
                                Caesar’s victory. Let him hoist you up in front of the shouting
                                crowds! Follow his chariot, like the greatest disgrace to your whole
                                gender. Let them exhibit you to the public for meager coins, like a
                                monstrosity. Then let Octavia dig up your face with her
                                nails.
