                            Take hence this jack and whip
                                him.
(aside) ’Tis
                                better playing with a lion’s whelpThan with an old one dying.                                                        Moon and
                                stars!Whip him. Were ’t twenty of the greatest tributariesThat do acknowledge Caesar, should I find themSo saucy with the hand of she here—what’s her
                                nameSince she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,Till like a boy, you see him cringe his faceAnd whine aloud for mercy. Take him hence.Mark Antony—                                 Tug him away! Being
                                whipped,Bring him again. This jack of Caesar’s shallBear us an errand to him.

CLEOPATRA
) You were half blasted ere I knew
                                you. Ha!Have I my pillow left unpressed in Rome,Forborne the getting of a lawful race,And by a gem of women, to be abusedBy one that looks on feeders?                                                         Good my
                                lord—You have been a boggler ever.But when we in our viciousness grow hard—Oh, misery on ’t!—the wise gods seel our eyes,In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make
                                usAdore our errors, laugh at ’s while we strutTo our confusion.#LBSFORGOLDTake away this lout and whip him.
(aside) It’s
                                safer to toy with a lion cub than an old, dying lion.By the moon and stars! Whip him! If I saw twenty of the greatest
                                powers that pay tribute to Caesar taking such liberties with her
                                hand—what’s her name now? This woman who once was Cleopatra, but now
                                has become something different? Whip him, fellows, until he screws
                                up his face like a baby and cries aloud for mercy! Take him
                                away.Mark Antony—Pull him away, and once he has been whipped, bring him back.
                                Caesar’s knave will bring him a message for us.

CLEOPATRA
) You were damaged goods before I met
                                you. Ha! Did I desert my bed in Rome, passing up the chance to have
                                a legitimate family with a jewel of a woman, in order to be deceived
                                by one who wastes her favors on servants?My good lord—You’ve always been a liar. But when our vices become habits—Oh,
                                the sadness of it!—the wise gods blind us, shade our better
                                judgment, make us love our mistakes, and laugh as we strut to our
                                ruin.
