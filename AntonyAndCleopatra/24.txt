Fulvia is dead.Sir?
Fulvia is dead.Fulvia?Dead. Why, sir, give the gods a thankful
                                sacrifice. When it 
pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
                                from 
him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth,
                                comforting 
therein, that when old robes are worn out, there are 
members to make new. If there were no more women but 
Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and
                                the case to be 
lamented. This grief is crowned with consolation.
                                Your 
old smock brings forth a new petticoat, and indeed
                                the 
tears live in an onion that should water this
                                sorrow.
The business she hath broached in the stateCannot endure my absence. And the business you have broached here cannot be
                                without 
you, especially that of Cleopatra’s, which wholly
                                depends 
on your abode.
No more light answers. Let our officersHave notice what we purpose. I shall breakThe cause of our expedience to the QueenAnd get her leave to part. For not aloneThe death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,Do strongly speak to us, but the letters tooOf many our contriving friends in RomePetition us at home. Sextus PompeiusHath given the dare to Caesar and commandsThe empire of the sea. Our slippery people,Whose love is never linked to the deserverTill his deserts are past, begin to throwPompey the Great and all his dignitiesUpon his son, who—high in name and power,Higher than both in blood and life—stands upFor the main soldier, whose quality, going on,The sides o’ th’ world may danger. Much is breeding Which, like the courser’s hair, hath yet but life,And not a serpent’s poison. Say our pleasure,To such whose place is under us, requiresOur quick remove from hence.#LBSFORGOLDFulvia is dead.Pardon me?Fulvia is dead.Fulvia?Dead.Then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks.
                                When a man’s wife dies, he can be comforted by the knowledge that
                                there are replacements to be found. If Fulvia were the last woman on
                                earth, there would be a reason to grieve. But in this way, grief and
                                comfort appear together. The only kind of tears you should shed in
                                this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your
                                nose. I must go and continue the business Fulvia started. The business you began here needs you as well—especially the
                                business with Cleopatra, which only you can attend to.Enough of this frivolous talk. Give our officers notice of our
                                intentions. I’ll tell the Queen the reason for our quick departure
                                and get her permission to leave. Fulvia’s death and the pressing
                                concerns related to it are not the only reasons I am eager to go;
                                friends in Rome have also sent many letters advising my return.
                                Sextus Pompeius has challenged Caesar. His fleet controls the sea.
                                Our fickle citizens—who never reward service until that service is
                                over—are now giving all the rights and honors won by Pompey the
                                Great to his son, Sextus. Sextus has great honor and power, and his
                                spirit and energy are even greater, all of which makes him the most
                                formidable soldier in the empire. The empire may be in danger if
                                he’s not restrained before he reaches his full potential. There are
                                many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full-fledged
                                threats.
