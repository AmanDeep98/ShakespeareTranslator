Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and nowPleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus’ deathMake me revenger. Bear the King’s son’s bodyBefore our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,Pays this for Marcus Crassus.                                                           Noble
                                Ventidius,Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,The fugitive Parthians follow. Spur through Media,Mesopotamia, and the shelters whitherThe routed fly. So thy grand captain, Antony,Shall set thee on triumphant chariots andPut garlands on thy head.                                                  O Silius,
                                Silius,I have done enough. A lower place, note well,May make too great an act. For learn this, Silius:Better to leave undone than by our deedAcquire too high a fame when him we serve’s
                                away.Caesar and Antony have ever wonMore in their officer than person. Sossius,One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,For quick accumulation of renown,Which he achieved by th’ minute, lost his
                                favor.Who does i’ th’ wars more than his captain canBecomes his captain’s captain; and ambition,The soldier’s virtue, rather makes choice of lossThan gain which darkens him.I could do more to do Antonius good,But ’twould offend him, and in his offenseShould my performance perish.#LBSFORGOLDNow I’ve paid you back, Parthia, and gotten revenge for Marcus
                                Crassus’ death. Carry King OrodesOrodes was King of Parthia and father of Pacorus. He assassinated Marcus Crassus, a member of the first Roman triumvirate.King Orodes’ son at the front of our army, so
                                all the Parthians will know—Orodes, Pacorus pays for Marcus Crassus!
                            Noble Ventidius, while your sword is still warm with the blood of
                                slain Parthians, why not finish the job? The Parthians retreat. Go
                                after them. Chase them down if you have to track them through Media, MesopotamiaMedia and Mesopotamia were countries bordering ParthiaMedia,
                                Mesopotamia, or any other places they may go to hide. Then our great
                                general, Antony, will commend you. Oh, Silius, Silius, I’ve done enough. A subordinate may exceed his
                                authority. You must understand, Silius, that it’s better to leave
                                something undone than achieve too much fame in your superior’s
                                absence. Caesar and Antony have always achieved more by delegating
                                authority to their officers than by leading their troops in person.
                                Sossius, an officer that held the same position in Syria as I do
                                here, achieved great distinction very quickly but lost Antony’s
                                support as a result. A man who achieves more in war than his captain
                                does becomes his captain’s rival. Ambition is a good quality in a
                                soldier, but it proves detrimental rather than beneficial when used
                                to surpass his superiors. I could do more to help Antony, but to do
                                so would insult him. And by insulting him, I would lose credit for
                                the good I have done him already.
