                                cannot hopeCaesar and Antony shall well greet together.His wife that’s dead did trespasses to Caesar.His brother warred upon him, although, I think,Not moved by Antony.                                              I know not,
                                Menas,How lesser enmities may give way to greater.Were ’t not that we stand up against them all,’Twere pregnant they should square between themselves,For they have entertainèd cause enoughTo draw their swords. But how the fear of usMay cement their divisions and bind upThe petty difference, we yet not know.Be ’t as our gods will have ’t. It only standsOur lives upon to use our strongest hands.Come, Menas.#LBSFORGOLDI don’t expect Caesar and Antony will have a very friendly
                                reunion. Antony’s dead wife raised an army against him, as did his
                                brother, though I don’t think Antony instigated it.Menas, I don’t understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by
                                greater ones. If it weren’t for the fact that we oppose all three of
                                them together, they’d be fighting each other. They certainly have
                                enough provocation. But it’s possible the fear of us may mend their
                                petty differences, though how that will work out, we cannot say. It
                                will be as the gods see fit. In any case, our survival depends on
                                putting together the strongest force possible. Let’s go,
                                Menas.
