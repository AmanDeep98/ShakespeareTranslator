                                                        Antony,Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou onceWast beaten from Modena, where thou slew’stHirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heelDid famine follow, whom thou fought’st
                                against,Though daintily brought up, with patience moreThan savages could suffer. Thou didst drinkThe stale of horses and the gilded puddleWhich beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deignThe roughest berry on the rudest hedge.Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,The barks of trees thou browsèd. On the AlpsIt is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,Which some did die to look on. And all this—It wounds thine honor that I speak it now—Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheekSo much as lanked not.’Tis pity of him.Let his shames quicklyDrive him to Rome. ’Tis time we twainDid show ourselves i’ th’ field, and to that endAssemble we immediate council. PompeyThrives in our idleness.#LBSFORGOLDAntony, it’s time to stop your wild hedonism. When you were
                                defeated at the battle of Modena—where you killed the consuls,
                                Hirtius and Pansa—and then driven away, you had to face hunger and
                                thirst. And even though you were brought up as a gentleman, you
                                patiently tolerated more hardships than savages could withstand. You
                                drank horses’ urine and water from scum-covered puddles that even
                                animals would refuse. Though you were used to the finest foods, you
                                didn’t turn up your nose at the bitterest berries on the thorniest
                                bushes. You even ate bark from trees, as deer do in winter. Going
                                over the Alps, you ate strange meat that some men would rather die
                                than consume. And you went through all this—the comparison between
                                then and now shames you—in such a soldier-like way that you didn’t
                                seem to suffer at all. It’s too bad.Let’s hope his sense of shame will send him back to Rome quickly.
                                It’s time that we brought our armies into the field. Let’s call a
                                council of war immediately. Pompey is making the most of our
                                absence.
