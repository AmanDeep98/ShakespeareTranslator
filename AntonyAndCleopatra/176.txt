                                           Nay, I have
                                done.Here comes the Emperor.                                                 Is it not
                                strange, Canidius,That from Tarentum and BrundusiumHe could so quickly cut the Ionian seaAnd take in Toryne?—You have heard on ’t, sweet?Celerity is never more admiredThan by the negligent.                                             A good rebuke,Which might have well becomed the best of men,To taunt at slackness.—Canidius, we will fightWith him by sea.                                   By sea, what else?                                                                     Why
                                willMy lord do so?                              For that he dares us to ’t.So hath my lord dared him to single fight.Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia,Where Caesar fought with Pompey. But these offers,Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off,And so should you.                                       Your ships are not well
                                manned,Your mariners are muleteers, reapers, peopleEngrossed by swift impress. In Caesar’s fleetAre those that often have ’gainst Pompey fought.Their ships are yare, yours, heavy. No disgraceShall fall you for refusing him at sea,Being prepared for land.#LBSFORGOLDNo, I’ve had my say. Here comes the Emperor. Isn’t it strange, Canidius, that he could cross the Ionian Sea so
                                quickly from Tarentum and Brundusium and take Toryne?—Have you heard
                                about this, sweet? No one admires speed more than the lazy. That’s a good reprimand, suitable for reminding even the best of
                                men to guard against negligence. Canidius, we’ll fight him at sea.
                            Of course we’ll fight him by sea. What else?Why do you want to do that, my lord?Because he’s daring us to do it.So you’ve dared him to single combat.Yes, and you dared Caesar to fight the battle at Pharsalia, where
                                he fought against Pompey. But Caesar ignores offers that don’t give
                                him an advantage, and so should you.Your ships are not well crewed. Your sailors are mule drivers,
                                harvesters—men who were drafted quickly and have little training.
                                Caesar’s fleet is manned by mariners who already have experience
                                battling Pompey. His ships are maneuverable. Yours are slow and
                                awkward. Refusing to fight him at sea won’t disgrace you. You’ve
                                prepared for a land war.
