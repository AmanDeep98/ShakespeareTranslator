                                highness’ pleasure?Not now to hear thee sing. I take no pleasureIn aught an eunuch has. ’Tis well for theeThat, being unseminared, thy freer thoughtsMay not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?Yes, gracious madam.Indeed?Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothingBut what indeed is honest to be done.Yet have I fierce affections, and thinkWhat Venus did with Mars.                                                        O
                                Charmian,Where think’st thou he is now? Stands he or sits
                                he?Or does he walk? Or is he on his horse?O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!Do bravely, horse, for wott’st thou whom thou mov’st?The demi-Atlas of this earth, the armAnd burgonet of men. He’s speaking now,Or murmuring “Where’s my serpent of old Nile?”For so he calls me. Now I feed myselfWith most delicious poison. Think on me,That am with Phoebus’ amorous pinches blackAnd wrinkled deep in time. Broad-fronted

Why, madam?So I can sleep away the time while my Antony is gone. You think about him too much.That’s treason!I hope not, Madam.Eunuch! Mardian!What can I do for your highness?I don’t want to hear you sing. I’m not interested in anything a
                                eunuch can do. It’s a good thing for you that, being castrated, you
                                can better concentrate on my needs. Do you have desires?Yes, dear madam.Indeed?Well, not in deed, madam, since I can’t do anything unchaste. But
                                I do have intense passions—and I do think about what Venus did with MarsVenus, goddess of love, and Mars, god of war, were legendary lovers.what Venus did with
                                Mars. Oh, Charmian, where do you think he is now? Is he standing or
                                sitting? Or is he walking? Or is he on his horse? Oh, how fortunate
                                that horse is to have Antony on him. Do well, horse. Do you know
                                whom it is you carry? A man who carries responsibility for a third
                                of the world on his shoulders. He’s speaking now, or perhaps he’s
                                whispering, “Where’s my serpent of the Nile?” For that’s his pet
