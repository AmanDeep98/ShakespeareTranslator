                                sure everyone knows that. I will, Caesar.An era of universal peace is about to start. If this battle goes
                                well for us, there will be peace in all three corners of the worldAfrica, Asia, and Europe, which were all under Roman rulethree corners of the

                            Alexas deserted. He went to Judea as if on Antony’s business, but

                                for which I will blame myself so much that I’ll never be happy
                                again.
