                                                            You
                                have brokenThe article of your oath, which you shall neverHave tongue to charge me with.Soft, Caesar.No, Lepidus, let him speak.The honor is sacred which he talks on now,Supposing that I lacked it.—But, on, Caesar.The article of my oath?To lend me arms and aid when I required them,The which you both denied.                                                       Neglected,
                                rather,And then when poisoned hours had bound me upFrom mine own knowledge. As nearly as I mayI’ll play the penitent to you, but mine honestyShall not make poor my greatness nor my powerWork without it. Truth is that Fulvia,To have me out of Egypt, made wars here,For which myself, the ignorant motive, doSo far ask pardon as befits mine honorTo stoop in such a case.                                                ’Tis noble
                                spoken.If it might please you to enforce no furtherThe griefs between ye, to forget them quiteWere to remember that the present needSpeaks to atone you.#LBSFORGOLDYou’ve broken the terms of our sworn agreement. You will never be
                                able to say the same about me. Easy, Caesar.No, Lepidus, let him say what’s on his mind. Now he slanders my
                                honor, which is sacred to me. Go on, Caesar. What part of the
                                agreement did I break? You agreed to send me troops and weapons when I needed them. You
                                refused me both.I overlooked your request, but I did not deny it. Your request
                                came at a time when the poisonous effects of reveling caused me to
                                be unaware of my own actions. I will apologize as much as is
                                appropriate, but my apology will not diminish my great stature—or if
                                I am denied that honor, I will withhold my military might. The truth
                                is that to get me out of Egypt, Fulvia provoked riots here. And
                                though I am only indirectly the cause of all this trouble, I ask
                                your pardon to the extent that my honor permits me to lower myself
                                in such a situation.Spoken like a gentleman.If it’s okay with you, you should not press your grievances any
                                further, but realize that the current situation should be enough to
                                reconcile you.
