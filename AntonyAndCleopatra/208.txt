                                       That head, my lord?
(to the
                                    
AMBASSADOR
) To him again. Tell him he wears the
                                roseOf youth upon him, from which the world should noteSomething particular. His coin, ships, legions,May be a coward’s, whose ministers would prevailUnder the service of a child as soonAs i’ th’ command of Caesar. I dare him
                                thereforeTo lay his gay caparisons apartAnd answer me declined, sword against sword,Ourselves alone. I’ll write it. Follow me.
(aside) Yes, like
                                enough, high-battled Caesar willUnstate his happiness and be staged to th’
                                showAgainst a sworder! I see men’s judgments areA parcel of their fortunes, and things outwardDo draw the inward quality after themTo suffer all alike. That he should dream,Knowing all measures, the full Caesar willAnswer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subduedHis judgment too.                                      A messenger from Caesar.
                            What, no more ceremony? See, my women,Against the blown rose may they stop their nose,That kneeled unto the buds.—Admit him, sir.#LBSFORGOLDYour head, my lord?
(to the
                                    
AMBASSADOR
) Go back to him. Tell him that his
                                cheeks still bear the pink flush of youth, and that the world
                                expects to see something remarkable from him. His treasure, his
                                navy, and his armies might belong to a coward, and his ministers
                                might be able to succeed just as well on behalf of a child as under
                                the command of Caesar. Therefore, I dare him to lay aside his fancy
                                trappings and meet this old man in single combat, sword against
                                sword, just the two of us. I’ll write the challenge. Follow me.
                            
(aside) Oh,
                                that’s likely! Caesar, the great commander of troops, will surely
                                risk all he has gained in order to fight this gladiator in the
                                public square! I see that men’s judgments are tied to their
                                fortunes, and that external factors influence a man’s internal
                                qualities, making everything suffer. How could Antony, knowing how
                                luck stood on either side, still imagine that Caesar would respond
                                to his nonsense! Caesar, you’ve conquered his judgment too.A messenger has arrived from Caesar.With no more ceremony than that? See, ladies, how they scorn me
                                now. They pinch their noses to avoid smelling the dying rose whose
                                scent, as a bud, they happily inhaled. Show him in, sir.
