CHARMIAN
) He’s getting better,
                                but still it’s not his best. See, Charmian, how well this mighty
                                Roman portrays anger? I’ll leave you, lady.Polite sir, let me say one thing. Sir, you and I must part
                                company—no, that’s not it. Sir, you and I were lovers—no, that’s not
                                it, either. You already know all that. There’s something I’d like
                                to—oh, I’ve forgotten what I wanted to say. Just as Antony has
                                forgotten me. If you weren’t the queen of immaturity, I’d think you were
                                immaturity itself. It’s difficult to have such immaturity so close to my heart, but
                                bear with me. Even the traits that become me most kill me when you
                                don’t approve of them. Your honor is the reason you are leaving. So
                                I beg you not to listen to my foolishness. May the gods be with you.
                                May your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed.
