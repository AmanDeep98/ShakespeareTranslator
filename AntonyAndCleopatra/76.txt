                                      The power of Caesar,
                                andHis power unto Octavia.                                                 May I
                                neverTo this good purpose, that so fairly shows,Dream of impediment! Let me have thy handFurther this act of grace, and from this hourThe heart of brothers govern in our lovesAnd sway our great designs!                                                         There’s
                                my hand.A sister I bequeath you whom no brotherDid ever love so dearly. Let her liveTo join our kingdoms and our hearts, and neverFly off our loves again!                                             Happily, amen!I did not think to draw my sword ’gainst Pompey,For he hath laid strange courtesies and greatOf late upon me. I must thank him only,Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;At heel of that, defy him.                                                 Time calls upon
                                ’s.Of us must Pompey presently be sought,Or else he seeks out us.#LBSFORGOLDHe has both my power and my influence over Octavia.I wouldn’t dream of opposing such an obviously promising idea.
                                Let’s shake on it. If you go through with this plan, from now on
                                we’ll be brothers, and our love for one another will guide our
                                actions. Here’s my hand.I give you a sister whom I love more than a brother ever loved any
                                sister. She will be the bond that joins our kingdoms and our hearts.
                                We’ll never fight again. I’m happy to say “amen” to that!I didn’t think I would ever fight Pompey. He’s shown me unusual
                                deference lately, and I must repay his favors or risk a reputation
                                for ingratitude. That done, I can turn against him. There isn’t much time. Either we go after Pompey or he’ll come
                                after us.
