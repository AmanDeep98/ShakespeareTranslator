                                            He is dead,
                                Caesar,Not by a public minister of justice,Nor by a hirèd knife, but that self handWhich writ his honor in the acts it didHath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,Splitted the heart. This is his sword.I robbed his wound of it. Behold it stainedWith his most noble blood.                                                      Look you,
                                sad friends,The gods rebuke me, but it is tidingsTo wash the eyes of kings.                                                   And strange it
                                isThat nature must compel us to lamentOur most persisted deeds.                                                   His taints and
                                honorsWaged equal with him.                                              A rarer spirit
                                neverDid steer humanity, but you gods will give usSome faults to make us men. Caesar is touched.When such a spacious mirror’s set before him,He needs must see himself.                                                     O
                                Antony,I have followed thee to this, but we do launchDiseases in our bodies. I must perforceHave shown to thee such a declining day,Or look on thine. We could not stall togetherIn the whole world. But yet let me lamentWith tears as sovereign as the blood of heartsThat thou, my brother, my competitorIn top of all design, my mate in empire,Friend and companion in the front of war,The arm of mine own body, and the heartWhere mine his thoughts did kindle—that our stars,Unreconcilable, should divideOur equalness to this. Hear me, good friends—#LBSFORGOLDHe’s dead, Caesar. Not by public execution or an assassin’s knife.
                                He killed himself with the same hand that performed such brave acts.
                                With the courage his heart lent his hand, his hand in turn split his
                                heart. This is his sword. I pulled it from his wound. Look—his noble
                                blood is still on it. Listen, sad friends, though the gods may rebuke me, this news
                                would make kings cry. It’s strange that human nature makes us grieve for the very thing
                                we’ve been trying to achieve. His faults were equally matched by his virtues. There was never a ruler as excellent as he. But gods, you give us
                                faults so we’ll be human. Caesar is upset. It’s impossible for him not to see himself in Antony. Oh, Antony. I drove you to this. But we have to get rid of a
                                disease if it threatens our body. Either I had to ruin you, or you
                                would have ruined me.There wasn’t enough room in the world for both of us. Even so, let
                                me mourn, with tears that heal like a bloodletting, that you—my
                                brother, my greatest competitor, my partner in rule, my friend and
                                companion on the battlefield, the very arm of my body, and the heart
                                in which mine own heart’s thoughts lived—that our fates could not be
                                reconciled, which caused us to divide ourselves from one
                                another.Let me tell you, friends—
