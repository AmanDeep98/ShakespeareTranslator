                                mallardLeaving the fight in height, flies after her.I never saw an action of such shame.Experience, manhood, honor, ne’er beforeDid violate so itself.                                         Alack, alack!Our fortune on the sea is out of breathAnd sinks most lamentably. Had our generalBeen what he knew himself, it had gone well.Oh, he has given example for our flightMost grossly by his own!Ay, are you thereabouts? Why then, good night indeed.

                                hoisted his own sails and followed her like a lovesick duck. He left
                                the battle at the most crucial point. I never saw such a shameful
                                act. He betrayed his own experience, manhood, and honor. Terrible. Terrible.The battle on the sea is almost lost. If our general had been his
                                old self, we would have won. Oh, with his sordid desertion, he sets
                                the example for our own. Are you considering desertion, as well? Then everything must
                                really be finished.They fled toward Peloponnesus.It’s easy to get there. I’ll go there and ascertain their next

                                examples of the six kings who have already surrendered.
