                                honesty and I begin to square.The loyalty well held to fools does makeOur faith mere folly. Yet he that can endureTo follow with allegiance a fall’n lordDoes conquer him that did his master conquerAnd earns a place i’ th’ story.                                                          Caesar’s

If Caesar please, our masterWill leap to be his friend. For us, you knowWhose he is we are, and that is Caesar’s. So.—Thus then, thou most renowned: Caesar entreatsNot to consider in what case thou stand’st,Further than he is Caesar.                                                    Go on. Right

(aside) My
                                integrity and I begin to contradict each other. Being loyal to a
                                fool makes loyalty foolish. But a person who can bear to keep his
                                allegiance to a defeated lord defeats his lord’s conqueror and earns
                                a place in history.What does Caesar want?It is for your ears only.There are only friends here. Speak confidently.So they are possibly Antony’s friends.Sir, he should have as many as Caesar has. If he had that many
                                friends, then he wouldn’t need us. If Caesar chose, Antony would
                                jump at the chance to be his friend. As for us, you know we are
                                Antony’s, and he is Caesar’s.So be it. This, then, this is the message Caesar sends to you,
                                famous Queen: he implores you not to be concerned about your
                                situation. Just remember that he is Caesar.Respectfully put. Go on.He knows that you didn’t embrace Antony because you loved him, but
                                because you feared him.
