Then does he say he lent meSome shipping, unrestored. Lastly, he fretsThat Lepidus of the triumvirateShould be deposed, and, being, that we detainAll his revenue.                                Sir, this should be
                                answered.’Tis done already, and the messenger gone.I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel,That he his high authority abusedAnd did deserve his change. For what I have
                                conquered,I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,And other of his conquered kingdoms, IDemand the like.                                   He’ll never yield to
                                that.Nor must not then be yielded to in this.Hail, Caesar, and my lord! Hail, most dear
                                Caesar!That ever I should call thee castaway!#LBSFORGOLDThe people have heard it already, and they’ve been told of his
                                accusations.Who does he accuse?He accuses me of withholding his share of Sextus Pompeius’
                                possessions, which we seized in Sicily. Then he says I didn’t return
                                some ships he loaned me. Finally, he criticizes the deposing of
                                Lepidus, and then goes on to accuse me of keeping all of Lepidus’
                                property for myself. Sir, these accusations should be answered.It has been done already, and the messenger is on his way. I
                                answered that Lepidus had become too brutal and abused his position.
                                For this he deserved to be deposed. As for what I seized in the
                                wars, I granted that Antony should have a share. But I also demanded
                                my share of his acquisitions in Armenia and the other conquered
                                kingdoms.He’ll never agree to that.Then we won’t agree to his demands.Greetings, Caesar, my lord! Greetings, dearest Caesar!Oh, to think you’ve been rejected!
