                                Octavia,Read not my blemishes in the world’s report.I have not kept my square, but that to comeShall all be done by th’ rule. Good night, dear lady.

CAESAR
) Good night, sir.Good night.Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt? Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither.
                            
If you can, your reason? I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue.
                                But yet 
hie you to Egypt again.
Say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher,Caesar’s or mine?Caesar’s.Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.Thy dæmon—that thy spirit which keeps thee—isNoble, courageous, high, unmatchableWhere Caesar’s is not. But near him thy angelBecomes afeard, as being o’erpowered. ThereforeMake space enough between you.#LBSFORGOLD

) There will be times when my duties
                                and responsibilities take me away from you.And I will spend our time apart on my knees, praying for you.
                            
(to
                                    
CAESAR
) Good night, sir. My Octavia, don’t
                                believe everything you hear about me. I haven’t always lived a
                                conventional life, but the future will be by the book. Good night,
                                dear lady. (to
                                    
CAESAR
) Good night, sir.Good night.Now, sirrahterm of address for a person of lower statussirrah, I hear you wish you were back in Egypt. I wish I had never left Egypt and that you had never come to
                                Egypt.Tell me why, if you can.It’s a feeling, but nothing I can put into words. But you had
                                better get back to Egypt again.Tell me who shall have the better luck, Caesar or me? Caesar. So you’d better not stay with him, Antony. Your guardian
                                angel is noble, courageous, significant, and unmatched when Caesar’s
                                not around. But when you are with him, your angel is weakened and
                                easily frightened. That’s why there must be space between you.
