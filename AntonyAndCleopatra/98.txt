                                                       Oh, from
                                Italy!Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,That long time have been barren.                                                                Madam,
                                madam—Antonio’s dead! If thou say so, villain,Thou kill’st thy mistress. But well and free,If thou so yield him, there is gold, and hereMy bluest veins to kiss—a hand that kingsHave lipped, and trembled kissing.First, madam, he is well.Why, there’s more gold. But, sirrah, mark, we useTo say the dead are well. Bring it to that,The gold I give thee will I melt and pourDown thy ill-uttering throat.Good madam, hear me.Well, go to, I will.But there’s no goodness in thy face—if AntonyBe free and healthful, so tart a favorTo trumpet such good tidings! If not well, Thou shouldst come like a Fury crowned with snakes,Not like a formal man.                                             Will ’t please you
                                hear me?#LBSFORGOLDOh! News from Italy! Cram your good news into my ears. It’s been
                                so long since I’ve heard from him.Madam, madam—Antony’s dead! If you say that, you bastard, you’ll kill your
                                Queen. If you say he’s healthy and free, I’ll give you money and you
                                may kiss my hand. Kings have trembled to kiss this hand. Let me say first, madam, that he is well.Well then, here’s more money for you. But you know, sirrah, we
                                customarily say that the dead are well. If that’s what you mean,
                                I’ll melt this gold and pour it down your throat that speaks these
                                hateful words.Good madam, let me speak.All right, I will. But you don’t look as if you bring good news.
                                If Antony is free and healthy, you shouldn’t wear such a sour face
                                while bringing such good news.If he’s not well, you should arrive like a FuryThe Furies were mythological figures who punished those who broke either natural or moral lawsFury with snakes for
                                hair, not in the shape of a normal man.Do you want to hear my news?
