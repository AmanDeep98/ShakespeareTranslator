                                              The gods withhold
                                me!Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,Though enemy, lost aim and could not?                                                                              Eros,Wouldst thou be windowed in great Rome and seeThy master thus with pleached arms, bending downHis corrigible neck, his face subduedTo penetrative shame, whilst the wheeled seatOf fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, brandedHis baseness that ensued?                                                  I would not see
                                ’t.Come, then, for with a wound I must be cured.Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast wornMost useful for thy country.                                                       O sir,
                                pardon me!When I did make thee free, swor’st thou not thenTo do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,Or thy precedent services are allBut accidents unpurposed. Draw and come.Turn from me then that noble countenanceWherein the worship of the whole world lies.Lo thee!#LBSFORGOLDThe gods forbid! Can I do what all the Parthian arrows, though
                                shot by enemies, could not? Eros, would you like to look through a window in Rome and watch
                                your master marching in Caesar’s victory parade, his arms crossed
                                and tied, his head bowed in submission, his face red from shame,
                                while the chariot of triumphant Caesar precedes him, putting the
                                final stamp to his humiliation? I would not.Then come on. I must be restored to health by an injury. Draw your
                                trustworthy sword, which you have used in such service to your
                                country.Oh, sir, pardon me!When I freed you from slavery, didn’t you swear to do this when I
                                asked you? Do it immediately, or all your previous services to me
                                were accidental, without purpose. Take out your sword and come
                                on.Then turn your noble face away from me, that face that the whole
                                world adores.Look!
