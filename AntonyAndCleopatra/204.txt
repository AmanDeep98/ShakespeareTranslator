                                perjureThe ne’er-touched vestal. Try thy cunning, Thidias.Make thine own edict for thy pains, which weWill answer as a law.                                         Caesar, I go.Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,And what thou think’st his very action speaksIn every power that moves.                                                      Caesar, I
                                shall.#LBSFORGOLDAs for Antony, I’m not interested in his requests. I’ll give the
                                Queen a hearing and grant her requests if she either throws her
                                dishonored friend out of Egypt or kills him. Then I’ll listen to
                                her. Give my answer to them both. May good luck follow you!Take him safely through the lines.

THIDIAS
) Now it’s time to test your
                                eloquence. On your way. Separate Cleopatra from Antony. In my name,
                                promise to fulfill her petitions. You can make up additional offers,
                                if necessary. Women aren’t strong, even at their best. Hardship will
                                make even a vestalvirgin priestessvestal abandon her vows. Use your ingenuity, Thidias.
                                You can make your own conditions, which I will authorize as
                                law.I go, Caesar.Observe how Antony takes his defeat and how his attitude
                                influences his actions. I will, Caesar.
