As for my wife,I would you had her spirit in such another.The third o’ th’ world is yours, which with a snaffleYou may pace easy, but not such a wife. Would we had all such wives, that the men might go

You know I would never approve a war against
                                my own cause. As for my wife, if only you had such a wife. It’s
                                easier to rule a third of the world than a wife like that. We should all have wives like that. Then the women could go to war
                                with the men.I had no control over her uprisings, Caesar, which arose from her
                                impatience—and were shrewdly undertaken, as well. I’m sorry she
                                caused you so much trouble. But you can’t blame me for her offenses.
                            I sent you a letter while you were carousing in Alexandria. You
                                put my letters in your pocket without reading them and then mocked
                                my messenger out of the room.Sir, he burst into the room without invitation, just after I had
                                come from an important banquet with three kings. I was not myself,
                                as a result of the wine. The next day I explained all this to him,
                                which was as good as begging his pardon. Let’s not fight over this
                                fellow. If we must argue, let us remove him from our
                                arguments.
