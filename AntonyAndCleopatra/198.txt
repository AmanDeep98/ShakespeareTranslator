Well then, sustain me. Oh!Most noble sir, arise. The Queen approaches.Her head’s declined, and death will seize her butYour comfort makes the rescue.I have offended reputation,A most unnoble swerving.                                                     Sir, the
                                Queen.Oh, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? SeeHow I convey my shame out of thine eyesBy looking back what I have left behind’Stroyed in dishonor.                                          O my lord, my
                                lord,Forgive my fearful sails! I little thoughtYou would have followed.                                                   Egypt, thou
                                knew’st too wellMy heart was to thy rudder tied by th’ strings,And thou shouldst tow me after. O’er my spiritThy full supremacy thou knew’st, and thatThy beck might from the bidding of the godsCommand me.                              Oh, my pardon!                                                               Now
                                I mustTo the young man send humble treaties, dodgeAnd palter in the shifts of lowness, whoWith half the bulk o’ th’ world played as I pleased,Making and marring fortunes. You did knowHow much you were my conqueror, and thatMy sword, made weak by my affection, wouldObey it on all cause.#LBSFORGOLDWell, then, help me.Most noble sir, stand up. The Queen is coming. She’s weak and will
                                die unless you comfort her. I’ve destroyed my reputation, a most shameful error. Sir, here’s the Queen.Oh, where have you led me, Egypt? See how I hide my shame from you
                                by turning around? I look behind me to see my past, destroyed by
                                dishonor. Oh, my lord, my lord, forgive my panic! I didn’t think you would
                                follow me. Queen, you knew very well that my heart was tied to your ship and
                                that you would pull me along with you. You knew that my spirit was
                                completely under your control and that I would ignore the gods’
                                orders in favor of yours. Oh, forgive me!Now I will have to send my humble proposal of peace to that young
                                man. I’ve done as I pleased with half the world, making and losing
                                fortunes, but now I negotiate from a position of weakness. You knew
                                how far you had conquered my spirit. You knew that my sword,
                                weakened by my love for you, would obey that love no matter what.
