                                Silvius, sir.He dreams. I know they are in Rome togetherLooking for Antony. But all the charms of
                                love,Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wanned lip!Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both.Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks,Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honorEven till a Lethe’d dulness—                                                         How now,
                                Varrius?This is most certain that I shall deliver:Mark Antony is every hour in RomeExpected. Since he went from Egypt ’tisA space for farther travel.I could have given less matterA better ear.—Menas, I did not thinkThis amorous surfeiter would have donned his helmFor such a petty war. His soldiershipIs twice the other twain. But let us rearThe higher our opinion, that our stirringCan from the lap of Egypt’s widow pluckThe ne’er lust-wearied Antony.#LBSFORGOLDFrom Silvius, sir.He’s dreaming. I know they’re in Rome together, hoping for Antony
                                to return. Lecherous Cleopatra, may all the charms of love soften
                                those withered lips! Join your witchcraft with your beauty, and let
                                Antony’s lust combine with both. Keep this libertine occupied with
                                endless debauchery. Keep his brain drunk and his appetite
                                unsatisfied, so that sleeping and eating make him drowsy and
                                forgetful of his duties, like the Lethemythical river of the underworld; to drink from it brought forgetfulnessLethe does.What’s the news, Varrius?This news is absolutely true: Mark Antony is expected to arrive in
                                Rome at any hour now. In the time since he left Egypt, he could have
                                traveled an even longer distance.I would have listened to less important news with greater
                                enthusiasm. Menas, I had no idea this amorous glutton would have put
                                on his helmet for such an insignificant war. His military ability is
                                double that of the other two. We must form a better opinion of
                                ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable Antony’s attention
                                away from that Egyptian widow.
