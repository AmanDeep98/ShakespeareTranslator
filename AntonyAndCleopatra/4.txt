Nay, hear them, Antony.Fulvia perchance is angry. Or who knowsIf the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sentHis powerful mandate to you, “Do this, or this.Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that.Perform ’t, or else we damn thee.”                                                                    How,
                                my love?Perchance? Nay, and most like.You must not stay here longer. Your dismissionIs come from Caesar. Therefore hear it, Antony.Where’s Fulvia’s process? Caesar’s, I would say—both?Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt’s queen,Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thineIs Caesar’s homager. Else so thy cheek pays shameWhen shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers! Let Rome in Tiber melt and the wide archOf the ranged empire fall. Here is my space.Kingdoms are clay. Our dungy earth alikeFeeds beast as man. The nobleness of lifeIs to do thus, when such a mutual pairAnd such a twain can do ’t, in which I bind,On pain of punishment, the world to weetWe stand up peerless.#LBSFORGOLDNo, listen to it, Antony. Perhaps FulviaFulvia is Marc Antony’s wife.Fulvia is angry with you. Who
                                knows, maybe the baby-faced CaesarOctavius Caesar was only in his twenties at this time, about twenty years younger than Antony.baby-faced Caesar has orders for you: “Do this, do
                                that; conquer that kingdom, liberate this one. Do it or we’ll
                                condemn you.” What, my love?Maybe? No, most likely. You can’t stay here any longer. Caesar has
                                sent your dismissal, so pay attention, Antony. Where’s Fulvia’s
                                summons—excuse me, I should have said Caesar’s. Or do Fulvia and
                                Caesar both beckon you back to Rome? Call in the messengers and
                                we’ll find out. As surely as I am the queen of Egypt, Antony, you’re
                                blushing, which means you’re Caesar’s servant. Or that that bitch
                                Fulvia still has the power to humiliate you. Call the
                                messengers!
Let Rome be washed away in the TiberRome was built on the river Tiber.Let Rome be washed away in the Tiber and let the great empire
                                fall. My place is here. Kingdoms are only dirt. The soil feeds
                                animals as well as people, so how does having a kingdom separate
                                humans from beasts? The noblest thing is to do what we’re doing,
                                particularly when the couple is as well matched as we are. I demand
                                that the world admit we are the perfect couple or else suffer the
                                consequences.
