                               Good Queen, let us entreat
                                you—O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,Doing the honor of thy lordlinessTo one so meek, that mine own servant shouldParcel the sum of my disgraces byAddition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,That I some lady trifles have reserved,Immoment toys, things of such dignityAs we greet modern friends withal, and saySome nobler token I have kept apartFor Livia and Octavia, to induceTheir mediation, must I be unfoldedWith one that I have bred? The gods! It smites meBeneath the fall I have. (to 
SELEUCUS
) Prithee, go hence,Or I shall show the cinders of my spiritThrough th’ ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man,Thou wouldst have mercy on me.                                                                  Forbear,
                                Seleucus.Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthoughtFor things that others do, and when we fallWe answer others’ merits in our name,Are therefore to be pitied.#LBSFORGOLDGood Queen, let me implore you—Oh, Caesar, I am so ashamed. You condescended to visit me here,
                                honoring my humble self with your lordly presence. And one of my own
                                servants increases my disgrace by adding his envy! Suppose, good
                                Caesar, that I have saved a few feminine trifles, some unimportant
                                trinkets. These have worth only as gifts to friends. And suppose I
                                have kept a few more expensive gifts aside for LiviaOctavius Caesar’s wifeLivia and Octavia, to
                                solicit their good wishes. Must I then be exposed by a person I’ve
                                supported? By the gods! It adds another blow to the many I have
                                already. (to
                                    
SELEUCUS
) Please leave, or I’ll show you
                                what’s left of my spirit since my fortune was ruined. If you were a
                                real man, you would have had mercy on me. Leave, Seleucus.You should also know that as head of state, we are often blamed
                                for the crimes of others. And though we may fall, we are still
                                responsible for their offenses. I am therefore to be pitied.
