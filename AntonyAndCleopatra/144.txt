                                                                             So,This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.No further, sir.You take from me a great part of myself;Use me well in ’t.—Sister, prove such a wifeAs my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest bondShall pass on thy approof.—Most noble Antony,Let not the piece of virtue, which is setBetwixt us as the cement of our love,To keep it builded, be the ram to batterThe fortress of it. For better might weHave loved without this mean, if on both partsThis be not cherished.                                            Make me not
                                offendedIn your distrust.                                 I have said.                                                         You shall
                                not find,Though you be therein curious, the least causeFor what you seem to fear. So the gods keep youAnd make the hearts of Romans serve your ends.We will here part.#LBSFORGOLDSo, there’s the signal to ride. Good-bye, noble Agrippa.Good luck, worthy soldier, and good-bye.You can’t go any further with us, sir.You take an important part of myself with you. Treat it
                                well . . . . Sister, be the kind of wife I hope you will be, and
                                that this great contract rests upon your being . . . Gracious
                                Antony, don’t let my sister, this epitome of virtue that connects
                                us, become the reason we separate.If you and I don’t value her equally, it would be better for us to
                                work out our differences without her.Don’t insult me with your distrust. I mean what I say.You won’t find any cause for anxiety, even if you look for one.
                                So, may the gods protect you and change the hearts of the Romans so
                                that they turn and give you their support. We’ll leave you here.
