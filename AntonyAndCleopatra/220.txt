                                repentThou wast not made his daughter, and be thou sorryTo follow Caesar in his triumph, sinceThou hast been whipped for following him.
                                HenceforthThe white hand of a lady fever thee;Shake thou to look on ’t. Get thee back to Caesar.Tell him thy entertainment. Look thou sayHe makes me angry with him, for he seemsProud and disdainful, harping on what I am,Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry,And at this time most easy ’tis to do ’t,When my good stars, that were my former guides,Have empty left their orbs and shot their firesInto th’ abysm of hell. If he mislikeMy speech and what is done, tell him he hasHipparchus, my enfranchèd bondman, whomHe may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,As he shall like, to quit me. Urge it thou.Hence with thy stripes, begone!                                                               Have
                                you done yet?Alack, our terrene moon is now eclipsed,And it portends alone the fall of Antony.#LBSFORGOLD

) If your father is alive, let him be
                                sorry you weren’t born a daughter. And you should be sorry to follow
                                Caesar in his triumphal parade, since you have been whipped for
                                following him. From now on, you should tremble and grow feverish
                                whenever you see the white hand of a lady. Get yourself back to
                                Caesar. Tell him how you’ve been treated. Be sure you tell him he
                                makes me angry with him, because he seems proud and disdainful,
                                harping on what I am now rather than what he knows. He makes me
                                angry—and that’s easy to do right now, now that my lucky stars have
                                abandoned me. If he doesn’t like what I’ve said or done, remind him
                                that he holds Hipparchus, a slave I freed. He may whip, or hang, or
                                torture him as he pleases. Then we will be even. Recommend that to
                                him. Take your whipping scars and go.Are you done yet?You, my earthly moon, are now eclipsed, and that alone foretells
                                my ruin.
