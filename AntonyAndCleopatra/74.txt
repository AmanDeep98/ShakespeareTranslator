I am not married, Caesar. Let me hearAgrippa further speak.To hold you in perpetual amity,To make you brothers, and to knit your heartsWith an unslipping knot, take AntonyOctavia to his wife, whose beauty claimsNo worse a husband than the best of men,Whose virtue and whose general graces speakThat which none else can utter. By this marriage,All little jealousies, which now seem great,And all great fears, which now import their dangers,Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales,Where now half-tales be truths. Her love to bothWould each to other and all loves to bothDraw after her. Pardon what I have spoke,For ’tis a studied, not a present thought,By duty ruminated.                                        Will Caesar speak?Not till he hears how Antony is touchedWith what is spoke already.What power is in AgrippaIf I would say, “Agrippa, be it so,”To make this good?#LBSFORGOLDIt’s true I’m not married, Caesar. Let me hear what Agrippa has to
                                say.If Antony were to take Octavia as his wife, you two would be bound
                                in eternal friendship. As brothers, your hearts would be tied
                                together in an unbreakable knot. She is beautiful enough for the
                                best of men. Her virtue and grace are unparalleled. With this
                                marriage, all the petty jealousies that now seem huge, and all the
                                great fears that are dangerous in themselves, would disappear.
                                People would become used to speaking the truth rather than gossip.
                                Since she would love both of you, you two would be joined in that
                                love. Excuse my bluntness. This is not a spur-of-the-moment
                                suggestion. I have been considering this for some time, in my duties
                                to both of you. What do you say, Caesar?I’d rather hear your reaction to this first. If I said to Agrippa, “I agree. Make it happen,” does Agrippa have
                                the power to make it so?
