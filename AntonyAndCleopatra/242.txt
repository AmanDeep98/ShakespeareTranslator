                                business of war. When we love our job we get up early and go to it
                                joyfully. Even though it’s early, there are already a thousand armored
                                soldiers waiting for you at the harbor.The weather is fair. Good morning, General.Good morning, General.That was a fine fanfare, boys. Like a young man who wants to
                                amount to something, this morning begins early. (to

                                how it goes on. Well done.Farewell, lady.Whatever happens to me, this is a soldier’s kiss. It would be
                                shameful to draw out our good-byes. I’ll leave you without revealing
                                any emotion, like a man of steel. (to the others) Anyone who wants to
                                fight, follow me now, and I’ll see you get your wish. (to
