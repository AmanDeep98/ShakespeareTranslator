(aside) I must
                                stay his time. To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyesWith one that ties his points?                                                         Not know
                                me yet?Coldhearted toward me?                                                 Ah, dear, if I be
                                so,From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,And poison it in the source, and the first stoneDrop in my neck. As it determines, soDissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite,Till by degrees the memory of my womb,Together with my brave Egyptians all,By the discandying of this pelleted stormLie graveless till the flies and gnats of NileHave buried them for prey!                                                      I am
                                satisfied.Caesar sits down in Alexandria, whereI will oppose his fate. Our force by landHath nobly held. Our severed navy tooHave knit again, and fleet, threat’ning most sealike.Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear,
                                lady?If from the field I shall return once moreTo kiss these lips, I will appear in blood.I and my sword will earn our chronicle.There’s hope in ’t yet.#LBSFORGOLD
(aside) I must
                                wait for him to finish his tirade.In order to flatter Caesar, would you flirt with the servant who
                                laces up his pants?Don’t you know me still?Has your heart cooled toward me?Ah, dear, if that is true, let heaven make poisonous hail grow
                                from my heart, and let the first hailstone drop down my throat. As
                                it dissolves, so shall my life. The next hailstone should hit
                                Caesarion, until one by one all my children, and every one of my
                                brave Egyptians, are killed by the dissolving of this pellet storm
                                and lie unburied, covered by gnats and flies. I am satisfied. Caesar has made camp in Alexandria. I will fight
                                him there. Our land forces have bravely stood firm. Our tattered
                                navy has reassembled and set sail, as formidable as the sea itself.
                                Where have you been, my bravery? Do you hear what I say, lady? If I
                                come back from the battlefield again to kiss those lips, I’ll be
                                covered in blood. My sword and I will earn our place in history. We
                                still have hope.
