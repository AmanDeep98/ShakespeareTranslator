Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well.The elements be kind to thee and makeThy spirits all of comfort! Fare thee well.My noble brother!The April’s in her eyes; it is love’s spring,And these the showers to bring it on. (to 
OCTAVIA
) Be cheerful.

CAESAR
) Sir, look well to my husband’s
                                house, and— What, Octavia?                               I’ll tell you in your ear.Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor canHer heart inform her tongue—the swan’s-down featherThat stands upon the swell at the full of tideAnd neither way inclines.

AGRIPPA
) Will Caesar weep?
(aside to
                                    
ENOBARBUS
) He has a cloud in ’s face.
(aside to
                                    
AGRIPPA
) He were the worse for that, were he
                                a horse;So is he, being a man.
  (aside to
                                    
ENOBARBUS
)  Why, Enobarbus,When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,He cried almost to roaring, and he weptWhen at Philippi he found Brutus slain.#LBSFORGOLDGood-bye, my dearest sister, good-bye. I hope you have good
                                weather to set your mind at ease. Farewell. My noble brother!Her eyes are like April: full of showers. But they’ll flower into
                                    love. (to
                                    
OCTAVIA
) Be cheerful. 
(to
                                    
CAESAR
) Take care of my former husband’s
                                property, and—What is it, Octavia?I’ll tell you privately.She won’t say what she’s feeling, and she can’t understand her
                                feelings. She’s balanced uneasily, like a feather on the swell of a
                                great wave—she won’t move, even though her situation is about to
                                change.
(aside to
                                    
AGRIPPA
) Do you think Caesar will cry?
(aside to
                                    
ENOBARBUS
) He does look like it.
(aside to
                                    
AGRIPPA
) If he were a horse, watery eyes
                                would lower his value. Men aren’t supposed to cry, either.
(aside to
                                    
ENOBARBUS
) Why, Enobarbus, when Antony saw that
                                Julius Caesar was dead, he cried terribly. And he wept when he found
                                that Brutus had been killed at Philippi.
