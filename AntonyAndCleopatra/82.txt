                                                   Oh, rare for
                                Antony!Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,So many mermaids, tended her i’ th’ eyes,And made their bends adornings. At the helmA seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackleSwell with the touches of those flower-soft handsThat yarely frame the office. From the bargeA strange invisible perfume hits the senseOf the adjacent wharfs. The city castHer people out upon her, and Antony,Enthroned i’ th’ marketplace, did sit alone,Whistling to th’ air, which, but for vacancy,Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra tooAnd made a gap in nature.                                                    Rare
                                Egyptian!Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,Invited her to supper. She repliedIt should be better he became her guest,Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,Whom ne’er the word of “No” woman heard speak,Being barbered ten times o’er, goes to the
                                feast,And for his ordinary pays his heartFor what his eyes eat only.#LBSFORGOLDHow excellent for Antony!Her ladies-in-waiting—like Nereidessea nymphsNereides, or mermaids—tended to
                                Cleopatra as she watched them, and their graceful movements added to
                                the beauty of the scene. It seemed as if a mermaid were steering.
                                The silken sails and ropes swelled in the wind, expertly handled by
                                the ladies’ soft hands. People on the wharves could smell exotic
                                perfume wafting from the barge as it passed them. All the people
                                came out to see her, and Antony, waiting for her in the marketplace,
                                was left alone. Even the air itself would have gone to look at
                                Cleopatra, if that wouldn’t have caused an unnatural vacuum in the
                                atmosphere. Extraordinary Egyptian!When she landed at the port, Antony sent an invitation for her to
                                come to supper. She replied by saying that it would be better for
                                him to be her guest instead. Our courteous Antony, who has never
                                said “no” to any woman, after spending plenty of time being groomed
                                by the barber, goes to the feast. For that simple meal, he paid with
                                his heart—even though it was only his eyes that were
                                satisfied.
