                                portrayed as a drunk, and I’ll see some boy with a squeaking voice
                                play Cleopatra as if I were a whore.Oh, the good gods!No, that’s the truth.I’ll never see it. I know my nails are stronger than my eyes; I’ll

                                And after you’ve done this chore, I’ll give you permission to amuse
