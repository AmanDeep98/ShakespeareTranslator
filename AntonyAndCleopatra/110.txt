Your hostages I have, so have you mine,And we shall talk before we fight.                                                                 Most
                                meetThat first we come to words, and therefore have weOur written purposes before us sent,Which, if thou hast considered, let us knowIf ’twill tie up thy discontented swordAnd carry back to Sicily much tall youthThat else must perish here.                                                      To you all
                                three,The senators alone of this great world,Chief factors for the gods: I do not knowWherefore my father should revengers want,Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,There saw you laboring for him. What was ’tThat moved pale Cassius to conspire? And whatMade the all-honored, honest Roman Brutus,With the armed rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,To drench the Capitol, but that they wouldHave one man but a man? And that is itHath made me rig my navy, at whose burdenThe angered ocean foams, with which I meantTo scourge th’ ingratitude that despiteful RomeCast on my noble father.#LBSFORGOLD
I have your hostages and you have mine. Let’s talk before we fight.In order to conduct negotiations in safety, warring sides exchanged important persons and held the hostages until negotiations were complete.I have your hostages and you have mine. Let’s talk before we
                                fight.
It’s proper that we speak first, which is why we sent our
                                proposals ahead of us for your consideration. If you’ve had time to
                                think over these points, let us know whether they will relieve your
                                frustration. If yes, then a lot of brave young men can return to
                                Sicily who would otherwise die here. I address the three of you, the sole rulers of this world and the
                                main arbiters of the gods’ will. I don’t know why my father’s death
                                shouldn’t be avenged, since he has a son and friends to do it. You
                                avenged Julius Caesar’s death at Philippi, where his ghost haunted
                                his killer, Brutus. Why did Cassius conspire against Caesar? And why
                                did the honorable, well-intentioned Brutus and the others, men
                                devoted to the ideal of freedom, assassinate Caesar? They didn’t
                                want one man to be king in Rome.And that’s why I’ve built my navy, which is so huge that the
                                weight of the ships makes the sea foam with anger. I will punish
                                Rome for her ingratitude toward my noble father.
