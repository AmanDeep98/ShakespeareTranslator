What do you think,
                                girl!Even though there are some gray hairs among the brown, I still
                                have a brain and muscles that will let me compete with younger men.
                                Look at this man. Show him favor by letting him kiss your hand.

SCARUS
) Friend, I’ll give you armor made of
                                gold. It belonged to a king.He deserves it, even if it were covered with jewels like holy
                                Phoebus’ carthe chariot that the sun god Phoebus drove across the skyPhoebus’ car. Give me your hand. Let’s have a cheerful march through
                                Alexandria, proudly carrying our dented shields. If we had enough
                                room in the palace to house this army, we’d all eat together and
                                toast tomorrow, which promises to be full of danger. Trumpeters,
                                blast the city’s ears. Mix your fanfares with our drums, so that
                                sounds from both heaven and earth will herald our approach.#LBSFORGOLD
