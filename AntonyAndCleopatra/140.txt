Thou hast, Ventidius, thatWithout the which a soldier and his swordGrants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to
                                Antony?I’ll humbly signify what in his name,That magical word of war, we have effected:How with his banners and his well-paid ranksThe ne’er-yet-beaten horse of ParthiaWe have jaded out o’ th’ field.                                                            Where
                                is he now?He purposeth to Athens, whither, with what hasteThe weight we must convey with’s will permit,We shall appear before him. (to the soliders) On, there. Pass
                                along!#LBSFORGOLDA soldier is just a tool, like his sword, unless he has your
                                qualities, Ventidius. Are you going to write Antony about
                                this?I’ll modestly tell him what I have done in his name—that’s the
                                magical wording these days. I’ll write how, under his flag and with
                                his well-paid troops, we have beaten the formerly unvanquished
                                Parthia. Where’s Antony now?He plans to go to Athens. We must arrive there before him, as
                                quickly as our baggage train will allow us. (to the soldiers) Get a move
                                on!
