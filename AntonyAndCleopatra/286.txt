I will o’ertake thee, Cleopatra, andWeep for my pardon. So it must be, for nowAll length is torture. Since the torch is out,Lie down and stray no farther. Now all laborMars what it does. Yea, very force entanglesItself with strength. Seal then, and all is done.—Eros!—I come, my Queen.—Eros!—Stay for me.Where souls do couch on flowers, we’ll hand in hand,And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops,And all the haunt be ours.—Come, Eros, Eros!What would my lord?                                           Since Cleopatra
                                diedI have lived in such dishonor that the godsDetest my baseness. I, that with my swordQuartered the world, and o’er green Neptune’s backWith ships made cities, condemn myself to lackThe courage of a woman—less noble mindThan she which by her death our Caesar tells“I am conqueror of myself.” Thou art sworn, Eros,That when the exigent should come which nowIs come indeed, when I should see behind meTh’ inevitable prosecution ofDisgrace and horror, that on my command,Thou then wouldst kill me. Do ’t. The time is come.Thou strik’st not me, ’tis Caesar thou defeat’st.Put color in thy cheek.#LBSFORGOLDI will catch up with you, Cleopatra, and weep for your
                                forgiveness. It’s the only way left, because now any extension of my
                                life would be torture. Since the light of my life has gone out, I’ll
                                stop here. Now any effort ruins what it attempts. Yes, even power
                                gets in its own way. End it, then, and everything is over.—Eros!—I’m
                                coming, my Queen!—Eros!—Wait for me. In the place where souls
                                recline on beds of flowers we’ll walk hand in hand and amaze the
                                other ghosts with our spirited demeanor. Those famous lovers, Dido
                                and Aeneas, will lose their admirers, and the whole place will be
                                devoted to us.—Come, Eros. Eros!What can I do for my lord?Since Cleopatra died, I have lived in such dishonor that the gods
                                despise my disgrace. Though I have made conquests throughout the
                                four corners of the world and sailed with fleets so large they
                                looked like floating cities, I don’t have as much courage as a
                                woman. I have less nobility than the lady who, by killing herself,
                                says to Caesar, “Only Cleopatra can defeat Cleopatra.” You promised
                                me, Eros, that should the ultimate moment arrive—which it has—when
                                dishonor and disgust are inevitable, that upon my command, you would
                                kill me. Do it. This is that time. You won’t be striking me down,
                                but defeating Caesar. Call up your courage.
