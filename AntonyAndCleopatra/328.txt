                         Take to you no hard thoughts.The record of what injuries you did us,Though written in our flesh, we shall rememberAs things but done by chance.                                                           Sole
                                sir o’ th’ world,I cannot project mine own cause so wellTo make it clear, but do confess I haveBeen laden with like frailties which beforeHave often shamed our sex.                                                      Cleopatra,
                                knowWe will extenuate rather than enforce.If you apply yourself to our intents,Which towards you are most gentle, you shall findA benefit in this change, but if you seekTo lay on me a cruelty by takingAntony’s course, you shall bereave yourselfOf my good purposes and put your childrenTo that destruction which I’ll guard them fromIf thereon you rely. I’ll take my leave.And may, through all the world! ’Tis yours, and we,Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest,
                                shallHang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.#LBSFORGOLDDon’t think I blame you. Whatever injuries I received in the war,
                                I put down to the fortunes of war. You are now the sole lord of the entire world. I can’t explain my
                                cause very clearly. I must admit to having the weaknesses that all
                                women are accused of. Cleopatra, understand that, rather than emphasize our power over
                                you, we will soften if you accept our intentions, which are very
                                compassionate toward you. Your acceptance will benefit you, but if
                                you try to make me look cruel by committing suicide as Antony did, I
                                won’t be so generous.Your children will be destroyed, a fate your submission will save
                                them from. I’ll leave you now. You may do whatever you want in the world. It’s yours, and you may
                                hang us, your trophies of war, anywhere you like. Here, my good
                                lord.
