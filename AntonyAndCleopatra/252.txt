                                                Enobarbus,
                                AntonyHath after thee sent all thy treasure, withHis bounty overplus. The messengerCame on my guard, and at thy tent is nowUnloading of his mules.I give it you.Mock not, Enobarbus.I tell you true. Best you safed the bringerOut of the host. I must attend mine office,Or would have done ’t myself. Your EmperorContinues still a Jove.I am alone the villain of the earth,And feel I am so most. O Antony,Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paidMy better service, when my turpitudeThou dost so crown with gold! This blows my
                                heart.If swift thought break it not, a swifter meanShall outstrike thought, but thought will do ’t, I feel.I fight against thee? No, I will go seekSome ditch wherein to die. The foul’st best fitsMy latter part of life.#LBSFORGOLDEnobarbus, Antony has sent you all your treasure, with generous
                                gifts besides. The messenger arrived on my watch and is unloading
                                his mules at your tent. It’s yours.Don’t joke about this, Enobarbus. I’m telling you the truth. You’d
                                better bring the messenger safely through the lines so he can
                                return. I’d do it myself, but I can’t leave my post. Your Emperor is
                                still a king among gods. I am the worst person alive, and I know it the best. Oh, Antony,
                                you extravagantly generous man, how would you have rewarded me for
                                serving you faithfully when you reward my badness with all of this
                                gold! My heart feels like it’s about to explode. If grief doesn’t
                                kill me, I’ll find a quicker way to kill myself—even though I think
                                grief will do the job just as well. I, fight against you, Antony?
                                No, I’ll go find some ditch to die in. The foulest fate would be
                                most appropriate for me now in this latest phase of my life.#LBSFORGOLD
