                                news.Thy biddings have been done, and every hour,Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have reportHow ’tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,And it appears he is beloved of thoseThat only have feared Caesar. To the portsThe discontents repair, and men’s reportsGive him much wronged.                                                  I should have

This common body,Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tideTo rot itself with motion.Caesar, I bring thee wordMenecrates and Menas, famous pirates,Make the sea serve them, which they ear and

Many hot inroadsThey make in Italy—the borders maritimeLack blood to think on ’t—and flush youth revolt.No vessel can peep forth, but ’tis as soonTaken as seen, for Pompey’s name strikes moreThan could his war resisted.#LBSFORGOLDHere’s more news.We’ve followed your commands, lord Caesar. You shall have hourly
                                updates regarding the situation at sea. Pompey has a strong navy.
                                All the people who only stayed with you out of fear are gathering at
                                the port to join him, in the opinion he’s been treated unfairly.
                            I should have known it. It’s been this way ever since the first
                                government was organized. People will transfer their support to a
                                strong figure until he becomes their actual leader. Then they will
                                value their former leader, even though the loss of their support has
                                made him powerless. The common crowd changes like the tide, to and
                                fro, serving whoever is on the rise. Their power is worn away by
                                their fickleness.Caesar, I have news about Menecrates and Menas, notorious pirates
                                who prowl the sea in a variety of ships. They’ve made many raids
                                upon Italy—and the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of
                                resisting them. The young, energetic men are joining Pompey. These
                                pirates can capture a ship as soon as it leaves the harbor, since
                                the simple mention of the name “Pompey” carries as much power as a
                                fleet of troops in battle.
