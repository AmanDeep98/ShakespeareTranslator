                                love to her, and she bore his childTheir son, Caesarionhis child. I saw her once hop forty feet down the street. When she stopped
                                she was so out of breath that she was panting. Her beauty made even
                                that weakness seem perfect, and even in her breathlessness she
                                seemed to pour out breath.Now Antony has to leave her completely.He’ll never leave her. Age won’t wither her, and her charms are so
                                varied that she never grows boring. With other women, the more
                                familiar you grow with them the less appealing they become.
                                Cleopatra, on the other hand, makes you desire her the more you see
                                her. Even her worst faults are charming, and holy priests bless her
                                even when she acts the slut.If beauty, wisdom, and modesty can settle Antony’s restless heart,
                                Octavia will be the best thing that has ever happened to him.Let’s go. Good Enobarbus, consider yourself my guest as long as
                                you’re here. I humbly thank you.#LBSFORGOLD
