                                gone,If it be well to live, but better ’twereThou fell’st into my fury, for one deathMight have prevented many.—Eros, ho!—The shirt of Nessus is upon me. Teach me,Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage.Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o’ th’ moon,And with those hands that grasped the heaviest clubSubdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die.To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fallUnder this plot. She dies for ’t.—Eros, ho!#LBSFORGOLDIf you wish to live, you had better get out of here. But I think
                                it would have been better if you’d let me kill you. One death would
                                have prevented the deaths of many others.—Eros, ho!—I’m wearing the shirt of Nessus.Hercules was killed by a shirt poisoned with Nessus’ blood. Wild with pain, he threw his servant Lichas all the way to the sea.I’m wearing the
                                shirt of Nessus. Hercules, my ancestor, teach me how to feel your
                                rage. I’ll toss Lichas to the moon and use my mighty hands to kill
                                my better self. The witch shall die.She sold me to that young Roman boy and now I’m ruined. She’ll die
                                for it.—Eros, ho!
