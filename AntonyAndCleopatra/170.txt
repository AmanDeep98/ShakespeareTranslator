                                ship. Where do you think he is now? He’s in Athens, my lord.No, he’s not. You’ve been deceived. Cleopatra summoned him. He’s
                                given his empire to a whore, and now they’re gathering kings to wage

                                determined to kill each other. You’re welcome here. I didn’t write about breaking the alliance
                                with Antony until I saw you were being misled and realized how
                                dangerous it would be to keep postponing preparations. Cheer
                                yourself. Don’t be troubled by the present situation, the
                                obligations of which must ruin your happiness. Don’t worry about

                                Nothing is more precious to me than you. You have been unbelievably
                                abused, and now the gods make us the dispensers of justice. Be
                                comforted. You will always be welcome to me.
