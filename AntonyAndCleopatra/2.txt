Nay, but this dotage of our general’sO’erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,That o’er the files and musters of the warHave glowed like plated Mars, now bend, now turnThe office and devotion of their viewUpon a tawny front. His captain’s heart,Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burstThe buckles on his breast, reneges all temperAnd is become the bellows and the fanTo cool a gypsy’s lust.                                            Look where they
                                come.Take but good note, and you shall see in himThe triple pillar of the world transformedInto a strumpet’s fool. Behold and see.If it be love indeed, tell me how much.There’s beggary in the love that can be reckoned.
                            I’ll set a bourn how far to be beloved. Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.News, my good lord, from Rome.Grates me, the sum.#LBSFORGOLDNo, our general’s infatuation is out of control. His eyes used to
                                glow with pride when he reviewed his troops. Now his eyes devote
                                themselves exclusively to a certain brown-skinned face. His heart
                                used to burst the buckles on his breastplate in great fights, but
                                now he’s lost all temperance and dedicates his heart to satisfying
                                the lust of an Egyptian whore.Look at them. Take a good look, and you’ll see that one of the
                                three men who rule the world has turned into a whore’s jester. Look
                                and see.If what you feel is really love, tell me how much.It would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and
                                calculated.I want to measure the extent of your love, to see how far it
                                stretches.Then you would have to go beyond heaven, beyond earth.I have news from Rome, my good lord.Which irritaties me. Give me a summary.
