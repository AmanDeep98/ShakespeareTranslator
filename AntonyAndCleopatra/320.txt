                                                                Hold,
                                worthy lady, hold!Do not yourself such wrong, who are in thisRelieved but not betrayed.                                                      What, of
                                death too,That rids our dogs of languish?                                                             Cleopatra,Do not abuse my master’s bounty byTh’ undoing of yourself. Let the world seeHis nobleness well acted, which your deathWill never let come forth.                                                   Where art thou,
                                Death?Come hither, come! Come, come and take a queenWorth many babes and beggars!                                                               Oh,
                                temperance, lady!Sir, I will eat no meat, I’ll not drink, sir.If idle talk will once be necessary,I’ll not sleep neither. This mortal house I’ll
                                ruin,Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that IWill not wait pinioned at your master’s court,Nor once be chastised with the sober eyeOf dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me upAnd show me to the shouting varletryOf censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in EgyptBe gentle grave unto me. Rather on Nilus’ mudLay me stark naked and let the waterfliesBlow me into abhorring. Rather makeMy country’s high pyramides my gibbetAnd hang me up in chains!#LBSFORGOLDStop, brave lady, stop! Don’t do such a shameful thing to
                                yourself. We’ve rescued you from yourself. We have not betrayed
                                you.What, am I being denied death, as well? The thing which even dogs
                                are given, to rid them of their suffering?Don’t insult my master’s generosity by killing yourself. The world
                                will see how noble he is by the way he treats you. Your death would
                                prevent that. Where are you, Death? Come here. Come, and you can have a queen.
                                One queen is worth more than a whole number of babies and beggars,
                                your cheapest conquests.Oh, control yourself, lady!Sir, I won’t eat. I won’t drink. And don’t expect me to talk. I
                                won’t sleep either. I’ll destroy my body. Let Caesar do whatever he
                                wants. You’d better understand that I won’t wait till I’m chained up
                                in your master’s court, and I won’t let myself be scolded even once
                                by dull Octavia. Shall I let them exhibit me to the shouting mobs of
                                Rome?I’d rather die in a ditch in Egypt, and make it my gentle grave.
                                I’d rather lie in the Nile mud with flies laying their eggs in me,
                                making me disgusting. I’d rather be hung in chains from one of our
                                pyramids!
