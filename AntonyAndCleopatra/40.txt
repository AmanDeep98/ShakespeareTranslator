You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,It is not Caesar’s natural vice to hateOur great competitor. From AlexandriaThis is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastesThe lamps of night in revel; is not more
                                manlikeThan Cleopatra, nor the queen of PtolemyMore womanly than he; hardly gave audience, orVouchsafed to think he had partners. You shall find thereA man who is th’ abstract of all faultsThat all men follow.                                        I must not think there
                                areEvils enough to darken all his goodness.His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,More fiery by night’s blackness, hereditaryRather than purchased, what he cannot changeThan what he chooses.You are too indulgent. Let’s grant, it is notAmiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sitAnd keep the turn of tippling with a slave,To reel the streets at noon, and stand the
                                buffetWith knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him—As his composure must be rare indeedWhom these things cannot blemish—yet must AntonyNo way excuse his foils when we do bearSo great weight in his lightness. If he filledHis vacancy with his voluptuousness,Full surfeits and the dryness of his bonesCall on him for ’t. But to confound such timeThat drums him from his sport and speaks as loudAs his own state and ours, ’tis to be chidAs we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,Pawn their experience to their present pleasureAnd so rebel to judgment.#LBSFORGOLDNow you’ll see, Lepidus, that I don’t disdain our noble ally
                                because of a personal whim. Here’s the news from Alexandra: Antony
                                fishes, drinks, and celebrates all night. He’s become as frivolous
                                and self-indulgent as PtolemyPtolemy was Pharaoh of Egypt and Cleopatra’s husband, now dead. (He was also her younger brother.)Ptolemy’s queen, Cleopatra. He rarely attends
                                to his duties or acknowledges he has partners to be considered.
                                Here’s a man who is the epitome of all the vices known to man.
                            I can’t believe there could be enough vice in the world to
                                outshine all the good in him. His faults stand out because they must
                                be compared to all his virtues, like stars that shine brightly
                                against the dark night sky. They’re more likely to be the result of
                                inherited weakness than independent choice.You’re too forgiving. Let’s say, for argument’s sake, that it’s
                                not improper to fool around with Ptolemy’s wife, or to trade a
                                kingdom for a joke. That it’s fine to engage in drinking matches
                                with inferiors, or stumble drunkenly through the streets in the
                                middle of the day, or get into fist fights with sweaty servants.
                                Even if we said that this behavior suits him—though only a man with
                                a perfect character could avoid being disgraced by such
                                antics—there’s no excuse for the extra work we’ve had to take on
                                while he’s been off amusing himself. If he’s been spending his
                                leisure time in lustful pursuits, then he’ll be punished with
                                venereal diseases, and that’s his business. But he’s wasting time
                                and resources vital to our cause and endangering both his position
                                and ours. He should be chastised, like any boy who knows what’s
                                right but chooses to satisfy his desires regardless.
