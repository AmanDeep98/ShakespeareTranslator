Wherefore’s this noise?                                               Here is a rural
                                fellowThat will not be denied your Highness’ presence.He brings you figs.Let him come in.                                   What poor an instrumentMay do a noble deed! He brings me liberty.My resolution’s placed, and I have nothingOf woman in me. Now from head to footI am marble-constant. Now the fleeting moonNo planet is of mine.                                          This is the man.Avoid, and leave him.Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,That kills and pains not? Truly, I have him, but I would not be
                                the party that 
should desire you to touch him, for his biting is
                                immortal. 
Those that do die of it do seldom or never
                                recover.
#LBSFORGOLDWhat’s that noise?There’s a farmer here who won’t leave without seeing your
                                Highness. He has brought you figs. Let him come in.What a poor instrument, that can do such a noble deed! He brings
                                me freedom. My mind is made up. There’s nothing of the weak woman
                                left in me. Now from head to foot I’m as firm as marble. Now the
                                inconstant moon has nothing to do with me.This is the man.Leave us.Do you have in there the pretty snake of the Nile that kills
                                without pain?I certainly do have him, but I wouldn’t advise you to touch him.
                                His bite is fatal. People who die of it seldom or never
                                recover.
