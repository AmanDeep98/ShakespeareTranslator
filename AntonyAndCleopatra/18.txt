Well, what worst?The nature of bad news infects the teller.When it concerns the fool or coward. On.Things that are past are done, with me. ’Tis thus:Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,I hear him as he flattered.                                                 Labienus—This is stiff news—hath with his Parthian forceExtended Asia: from EuphratesHis conquering banner shook, from SyriaTo Lydia and to Ionia,Whilst— “Antony,” thou wouldst say.                                                        O my
                                lord!Speak to me home. Mince not the general
                                tongue.Name Cleopatra as she is called in Rome.Rail thou in Fulvia’s phrase, and taunt my faultsWith such full license as both truth and maliceHave power to utter. Oh, then we bring forth weedsWhen our quick minds lie still, and our ills told
                                usIs as our earing.                                  Fare thee well awhile.#LBSFORGOLDWell, give me the worst news.The bearer of bad news is often blamed for it.Only if the hearer is a fool or a coward. Go on. As far as I’m
                                concerned, what’s past is done. It’s like this: as long as a person
                                tells me the truth, even though it means my death, I will listen as
                                though he praised me.The news is disturbing. LabienusQuintus Labienus was a Roman general charged with subduing Parthia, a hostile country in Asia Minor, and garnering Parthinian military support in the war against Antony and Octavius Caesar. When Cassius and Brutus were defeated, Labienus led the Parthians in a war against Rome, conquering some of the Roman territories in Asia along the way.Labienus, with the army he led in Parthia,
                                has conquered all of Asia, all the way to the Euphrates River,
                                including Syria, Lydia, and Ionia, while— “While Antony . . .” is what you want to say.Oh, my lord!Speak plainly. Don’t tone down what the people are saying. Call
                                Cleopatra what the Romans call her. Use Fulvia’s abusive language.
                                Freely scold me for my faults with as much severity as an enemy with
                                truth on his side. It’s easy to err when left to our own devices,
                                but criticism helps us to see our faults and correct them.Good-bye for a while.
