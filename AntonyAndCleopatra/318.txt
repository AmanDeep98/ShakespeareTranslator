                                Queen!O Cleopatra! Thou art taken, Queen.Quick, quick, good hands.#LBSFORGOLDBe content. You’re in the charge of an honorable man. Don’t be
                                afraid. You can ask for anything from my lord. His generosity flows
                                to anyone in need. If I can tell him that you have submitted to him
                                sweetly, he’ll request your assistance in finding ways in which he
                                can support you. Please tell him I have surrendered to his fortune. I give up to
                                him the glory he has won. I’m learning every hour how to be
                                subservient. I’d be happy to meet with him in person. I’ll tell him all of this, dear lady. Be at ease. I know he’s
                                sorry for your situation, especially since he caused it.
