                                just like the kind that asps deposit on the caves by the
                                Nile.That’s probably how she died. Her doctor told me she had searched
                                for an infinite number of easy ways to die. Pick up her bed and
                                carry her ladies out of the tomb. She shall be buried next to her
                                Antony. No other grave on earth shall hold a pair this famous.
                                Momentous events like these strike those that cause them. Antony and
                                Cleopatra’s story is as pitiable as my military exploits are
                                glorious. Our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then
                                depart for Rome. Come, Dolabella. See that there is a dignified
                                splendor to this great solemnity.
