I will be even with thee, doubt it not.But why, why, why?Thou hast forspoke my being in these warsAnd sayst it is not fit.                                            Well, is it, is
                                it?Is ’t not denounced against us? Why should not
                                weBe there in person?                                      Well, I could reply,If we should serve with horse and mares together,The horse were merely lost. The mares would bearA soldier and his horse.                                               What is ’t you
                                say?Your presence needs must puzzle Antony,Take from his heart, take from his brain, from ’s timeWhat should not then be spared. He is alreadyTraduced for levity, and ’tis said in RomeThat Photinus, an eunuch, and your maidsManage this war.                                   Sink Rome! And their tongues
                                rotThat speak against us! A charge we bear i’ th’ war,And as the president of my kingdom willAppear there for a man. Speak not against it.I will not stay behind.#LBSFORGOLDI’ll be straight with you. Do not doubt it.But why, why, why?You opposed my taking part in the war. You said it wasn’t
                                proper.Well, is it? Is it?Isn’t this war against me? Why shouldn’t I be there in
                                person?Well, I could answer that if we went to war on male and female
                                horses alike—the male horses would be totally distracted and
                                useless. The mares would be ridden by their riders and the male
                                horses.What do you mean?Antony will necessarily be distracted by your presence. You will
                                affect his heart and his head. You’ll take up time he can’t afford
                                to lose. He’s already criticized for frivolous behavior. In Rome
                                they say that your eunuch Photinus and your maids run the war.
                            Let Rome fall! May the tongues of our critics rot! I have
                                responsibilities in this war, and as the absolute ruler of my
                                kingdom I will carry out my duties as if I were a man. Don’t argue
                                against it. I won’t stay behind.
