You’ve strange serpents there?Ay, Lepidus. Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by
                                the 
operation of your sun. So is your crocodile.
They are so.

LEPIDUS
) Sit, and some wine. A health to
                                Lepidus!I am not so well as I should be, but I’ll ne’er
                                out.Not till you have slept. I fear me you’ll be in till then.  Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies’
                                pyramises are 
very goodly things. Without contradiction I have
                                heard that.

POMPEY
) Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee,
                                captain,And hear me speak a word.

MENAS
) Forbear me till anon.—This wine for
                                Lepidus!What manner o’ thing is your crocodile? It is shaped, sir, like itself, and it
                                is as broad as it 
hath breadth. It is just so high as it is, and moves
                                with 
its own organs. It lives by that which nourisheth
                                it, and, 
the elements once out of it, it transmigrates.
                            
What color is it of?Of it own color too.#LBSFORGOLDDo you have unusual snakes there?Yes, Lepidus.The Egyptian snake is born when the sun shines on the Nile mud,
                                just like the crocodile.Yes, Lepidus.Let’s have a seat and some wine. A toast to Lepidus!I don’t feel so well, but I won’t stop.Not until you pass out. I’m afraid you’ll keep going until
                                then.No, I certainly won’t stop. I’ve heard that the pyramids build by
                                the Ptolemies are splendid. Without doubt I’ve heard that.

POMPEY
) Pompey, could I have a word with
                                you?
(aside to
                                    
MENAS
) Whisper it in my ear. What is
                                it?
(whispers in
                                    
POMPEY
’s ear) Please, captain, leave the
                                feast and let me speak with you privately.
(aside to
                                    
MENAS
) Leave me alone awhile. Where’s the
                                wine for Lepidus?What does a crocodile look like?Sir, it’s shaped like itself and is as wide as it has width. It is
                                only as high as it is and moves with its own legs. It lives on what
                                nourishes it, and when the four elementsfire, air, earth, and water, thought to be the building blocks of all lifethe four elements leave it, its soul moves
                                into another body. What color is it?Its own color.
