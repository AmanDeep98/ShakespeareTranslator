Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield.Being so frustrate, tell him, he mocksThe pauses that he makes.                                                    Caesar, I
                                shall.Wherefore is that? And what art thou that dar’stAppear thus to us?                                      I am called Dercetus.Mark Antony I served, who best was worthyBest to be served. Whilst he stood up and spoke,He was my master, and I wore my lifeTo spend upon his haters. If thou pleaseTo take me to thee, as I was to himI’ll be to Caesar. If thou pleasest not,I yield thee up my life.                                            What is ’t thou
                                say’st?I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.The breaking of so great a thing should makeA greater crack. The round worldShould have shook lions into civil streetsAnd citizens to their dens. The death of AntonyIs not a single doom. In the name layA moiety of the world.#LBSFORGOLDDolabella, go see Antony. Tell him to surrender. His position is
                                hopeless. This delay makes him look ridiculous.Right away, Caesar.What are you doing with a sword? Who do you think you are coming
                                in here armed?My name is Decretus. I served Mark Antony, who was the commander
                                most worthy of my services. While he was alive, I lived only to
                                serve him and oppose his enemies. If you accept my service, I’ll
                                serve you the same way. If not, you can kill me. What are you saying?Caesar, I’m telling you that Antony is dead.When such a great man dies there should be a thunderclap. The
                                fractured world, in its confusion, should send lions into the city
                                streets and humans into the wilderness to live in lions’ dens. This
                                isn’t the death of one man. It’s the death of half the world.
