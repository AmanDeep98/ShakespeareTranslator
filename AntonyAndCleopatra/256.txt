Retire! We have engaged ourselves too far.Caesar himself has work, and our oppressionExceeds what we expected.O my brave Emperor, this is fought indeed!Had we done so at first, we had droven them
                                homeWith clouts about their heads.                                                             Thou
                                bleed’st apace.I had a wound here that was like a “T,”But now ’tis made an “H.”                                                       They do
                                retire.We’ll beat ’em into bench-holes. I have yetRoom for six scotches more.They are beaten, sir, and our advantage servesFor a fair victory.                                   Let us score their backsAnd snatch ’em up, as we take hares, behind!’Tis sport to maul a runner.                                                       I will
                                reward theeOnce for thy sprightly comfort and tenfoldFor thy good valor. Come thee on.#LBSFORGOLDRetreat! We’ve advanced too far. Caesar himself is in trouble and
                                there are more adversaries than we expected.Oh, my brave Emperor, this is what I call a fight! If we’d fought
                                like this before, we’d have driven them home with bandaged
                                heads.You’re bleeding a lot.I had a scar here that looked like a “T”; now it’s an “H.”They’re retreating.We’ll chase ’em into their latrines. I still have room for six
                                more wounds.They’re retreating, sir, and our superiority indicates a clear
                                victory.Let’s slash their backs and grab ’em like we do rabbits, from
                                behind. It’s fair game to mark a coward. I’ll reward you once for your cheerfulness and ten times for your
                                courage. Come on.
