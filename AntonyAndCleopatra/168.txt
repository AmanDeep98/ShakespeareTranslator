You have not called me so, nor have you cause. Why have you stol’n upon us thus? You come notLike Caesar’s sister. The wife of AntonyShould have an army for an usher andThe neighs of horse to tell of her approachLong ere she did appear. The trees by th’ wayShould have borne men, and expectation fainted,Longing for what it had not. Nay, the dustShould have ascended to the roof of heaven,Raised by your populous troops. But you are comeA market-maid to Rome and have preventedThe ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,Is often left unloved. We should have met youBy sea and land, supplying every stageWith an augmented greeting.                                                          Good my
                                lord,To come thus was I not constrained, but did itOn my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,Hearing that you prepared for war, acquaintedMy grievèd ear withal, whereon I beggedHis pardon for return.                                            Which soon he
                                granted,Being an obstruct ’tween his lust and him.#LBSFORGOLDYou’ve never thought of me like that, and you have no reason
                                to.Then why did you travel so quietly? You didn’t arrive like
                                Caesar’s sister. Antony’s wife should have an army to escort her,
                                with neighing horses to announce her arrival long before she
                                appears. The trees along the road should have been filled with eager
                                spectators. Crowds should have been faint with excitement waiting to
                                see you. The dust from your attending troops should have risen to
                                heaven. But you’ve arrived like a common maid bringing goods to a
                                Roman market. You’ve kept me from displaying my love—and when love
                                is not shown, it’s often not felt. I would have met you by sea and
                                again by land. At each stage of your trip there would have been a
                                more spectacular greeting. My good lord, I wasn’t forced to travel like this. It was my
                                choice. Mark Antony heard that you were preparing to wage war on
                                him. When he gave me this news, I begged him to let me visit you.
                            Which he quickly allowed, given that you’re an obstacle to his
                                lust.
