                                   How now, worthy soldier?O noble Emperor, do not fight by sea!Trust not to rotten planks. Do you misdoubtThis sword and these my wounds? Let th’ EgyptiansAnd the Phoenicians go a-ducking. WeHave used to conquer standing on the earthAnd fighting foot to foot.                                                  Well, well,
                                away.By Hercules, I think I am i’ th’ right.Soldier, thou art; but his whole action growsNot in the power on ’t. So our leader’s led,And we are women’s men.                                                    You keep by
                                landThe legions and the horse whole, do you not?Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea;But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar’sCarries beyond belief.While he was yet in RomeHis power went out in such distractions asBeguiled all spies.#LBSFORGOLDWhat’s the news, brave soldier?Oh, don’t fight by sea, noble Emperor! Don’t trust rotten planks.
                                Don’t you trust my sword and these wounds? Let the Egyptians and
                                Phoenicians go swimming. We are used to winning by standing on the
                                earth and fighting toe to toe. Well, well, let’s go.By Hercules, I think I’m right.Soldier, you are. But Antony’s decisions aren’t coming from his
                                extensive experience. Our leader is being led. We are following a
                                woman.On land you keep the legions and cavalry together, don’t
                                you?Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius, Publicola, and Caelius will go
                                by sea, but we’ll keep the bulk on land. Caesar’s speed defies
                                belief. While he was still in Rome, he deployed his forces in so many
                                different disguises that all our spies were fooled.
