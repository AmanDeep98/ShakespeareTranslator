Eros, thou yet behold’st me?                                                        Ay, noble
                                lord.Sometimes we see a cloud that’s dragonish,A vapor sometime like a bear or lion,A towered citadel, a pendant rock,A forkèd mountain, or blue promontoryWith trees upon ’t that nod unto the worldAnd mock our eyes with air. Thou hast seen these signs.They are black vesper’s pageants.                                                                  Ay,
                                my lord.That which is now a horse, even with a thoughtThe rack dislimns and makes it indistinctAs water is in water.                                         It does, my lord.My good knave Eros, now thy captain isEven such a body. Here I am Antony,Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.I made these wars for Egypt, and the Queen,Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine—Which whilst it was mine had annexed unto ’tA million more, now lost—she, Eros, hasPacked cards with Caesar and false-played my gloryUnto an enemy’s triumph.Nay, weep not, gentle Eros. There is left usOurselves to end ourselves.#LBSFORGOLDEros, can you still see me?Yes, noble lord.Sometimes we see a cloud that looks like a dragon. Sometimes
                                there’s a cloud like a bear or a lion, a castle, a floating rock, a
                                craggy mountain. Or it might look like a blue cliff with trees on it
                                that bow to the ground. These things fool our eyes by seeming solid,
                                when they are actually only air. You’ve seen these illusions.
                                They’re spectacles that appear at sunset.Yes, my lord.What looks like a horse is quick as thought disfigured by the
                                wind, made as difficult to distinguish as water poured into
                                water.That’s true, my lord.Eros, my young friend, your captain is now just like that cloud.
                                Here and now I seem like Antony, but I can’t keep myself in this
                                form, my boy. I went to war to save Cleopatra, whose love I thought
                                I had, since she had mine—and mine carried with it a million others,
                                those of my soldiers, now lost. The Queen conspired with Caesar to
                                undermine my success and assure his victory. No, don’t cry, kind
                                Eros. We still have the option of killing ourselves.
