Dispatch.—Enobarbus!#LBSFORGOLDMay the gods bless Antony today!I wish you and your scarred self had convinced me to wage our last
                                battle on land.If you had, the kings that have revolted and the soldier that
                                deserted this morning would still be behind you. Who deserted this morning?You don’t know? Someone who was always near you. If you call for
                                Enobarbus, he won’t hear you. Or if he can hear you from Caesar’s
                                camp, he’ll reply, “I’m no longer on your side.”What are you saying?Sir, he’s with Caesar. Sir, he left his belongings and treasure. He’s gone?It’s certain.Eros, send his treasure to him. Do it now. Don’t keep anything

                                traitors. Hurry. Enobarbus!#LBSFORGOLD
