                                             If it might please
                                ye—His face was as the heavens, and therein stuckA sun and moon, which kept their course and
                                lightedThe little “O,” the earth.                                                Most sovereign
                                creature—His legs bestrid the ocean. His reared armCrested the world. His voice was propertiedAs all the tunèd spheres, and that to friends.But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,There was no winter in ’t, an autumn ’twasThat grew the more by reaping. His delightsWere dolphinlike; they showed his back aboveThe element they lived in. In his liveryWalked crowns and crownets. Realms and islands wereAs plates dropped from his pocket.                                                                    Cleopatra—Think you there was or might be such a manAs this I dreamt of?                                       Gentle madam, no.You lie up to the hearing of the gods.But if there be nor ever were one such,It’s past the size of dreaming. Nature wants stuffTo vie strange forms with fancy, yet t’ imagineAn Antony were nature’s piece ’gainst fancy,Condemning shadows quite. #LBSFORGOLDIf you’d like—Authority radiated from his face, and his presence brought
                                knowledge and order to the people of earth. Your majesty—His power extended from one shore to the other, as if he straddled
                                the ocean with his legs. When he raised his arm in command, the
                                world trembled. He spoke exquisitely to his friends, but when he
                                wanted to terrify the world, his voice was like thunder. There was
                                no end to his generosity. The more he gave, the more he wanted to
                                give. His amusements showed another side of him, one detached from
                                his world of responsibility and duty. Kings and noblemen served him.
                                Kingdoms and provinces dropped from his pockets like loose
                                change.Cleopatra—Do you think there ever was, or could there ever be, a man such as
                                the one I dreamed about?No, gentle madam.The gods can hear you lying! But if there ever were such a man,
                                simple dreams could never contain his greatness. When it comes to
                                creating fantastical things, the natural world cannot compete with
                                imagination. And yet, if the natural world could create something
                                like Antony, it would have a masterpiece to rival anything fantasy
                                might construct. Antony would easily outshine all imaginary
                                beings.
