                                  How! Not dead? Not dead?The guard, ho! Oh, dispatch me!What’s the noise?I have done my work ill, friends. Oh, make an endOf what I have begun!                                             The star is
                                fall’n.And time is at his period.                                                   Alas, and
                                woe!Let him that loves me strike me dead.Not I.Nor I.Nor anyone.Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,Shall enter me with him.Where’s Antony?There, Diomed, there.Lives he? Wilt thou not answer, man?#LBSFORGOLDWhat! I’m not dead? Not dead?—Guard, here! Oh, kill me!What’s the trouble?I’ve botched the job, friends. Oh, finish what I’ve begun.Our guiding light is out.And time itself is ended.Sadness and despair!Whoever’s a real friend should strike me dead.Not me.Me neither.None of us.Your death and destiny advise your followers to escape.I only need to show your sword to Caesar and tell him about your
                                death to get into his good favor.Where’s Antony?There, Diomedes, there.Is he still alive? Why don’t you answer me, man?
