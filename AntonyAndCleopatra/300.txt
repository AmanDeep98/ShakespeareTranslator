I am dying, Egypt, dying. OnlyI here importune death awhile, untilOf many thousand kisses the poor lastI lay upon thy lips.                                     I dare not, dear,Dear my lord, pardon, I dare not,Lest I be taken. Not th’ imperious showOf the full-fortuned Caesar ever shallBe brooched with me. If knife, drugs, serpents,
                                haveEdge, sting, or operation, I am safe.Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyesAnd still conclusion, shall acquire no honorDemuring upon me. But come, come, Antony—Help me, my women—We must draw thee up.Assist, good friends.                                         Oh, quick, or I am
                                gone.Here’s sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!Our strength is all gone into heaviness,That makes the weight. Had I great Juno’s power,The strong-winged Mercury should fetch thee upAnd set thee by Jove’s side. Yet come a little.Wishers were ever fools. Oh, come, come, come!#LBSFORGOLDI am dying, Cleopatra, dying. I just beg death to wait awhile,
                                until I place the last of our many thousands of kisses on your
                                lips.I don’t dare come down—forgive me, my lord—I don’t dare, for fear
                                of capture. I will never be exhibited as lucky Caesar’s prize. If
                                knives, poison, or snakes have edge, effect, or venom, I am safe
                                from that fate. Your wife Octavia, with her self-effacing eyes and
                                self-righteous assumptions, won’t get any praise from patronizing
                                me. But come. Come up here, Antony—help me, ladies—we must carry you
                                up. Help us, good friends.Oh, quick, before I’m gone.Such exercise! My lord is so heavy! Our strength has all turned
                                into sadness. That’s what makes the weight. If I had the goddess
                                Juno’s power, I would make the strong-winged messenger, Mercury,
                                pick you up and seat you beside Jove. Up just a little more—wishes
                                are always foolish—oh, come on, come on, come on!
