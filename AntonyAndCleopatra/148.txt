                                that year. Whenever he had to kill, he cried—it’s true!—until I
                                cried too.

                                always write to you, and I’ll think about you all the time.Come here, sir. I’ll wrestle with you out of love. See, now I have
                                you. And thus I let you go and give you to the gods. Good-bye. Be happy.
