) You and I have known, sir. At sea, I think.We have, sir.You have done well by water.And you by land. I will praise any man that will praise
                                me, though 
it cannot be denied what I have done by land.
Nor what I have done by water.#LBSFORGOLDLet me shake your hand. I’ve never been your enemy. I’ve seen you
                                fight and envied your skill. Sir, I wouldn’t say I was your friend, but I’ve praised you when
                                you deserved ten times more praise than I gave. Enjoy your frankness; it suits you. I invite you all aboard my
                                ship. After you, my lords? Show us the way, sir.Come with me.
(to himself) Your
                                father would never have agreed to this treaty, Pompey. (to
                                    
ENOBARBUS
) You and I have met, sir.I think it was at sea.That it was, sir.You’ve done well at sea.And you’ve done well on land.I’ll flatter anyone who flatters me—though what I’ve accomplished
                                on land cannot be denied.Neither can my accomplishments at sea.
