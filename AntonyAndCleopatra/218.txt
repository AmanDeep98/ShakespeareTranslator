                                    Oh, is ’t come to this?I found you as a morsel cold uponDead Caesar’s trencher. Nay, you were a fragmentOf Gneius Pompey’s, besides what hotter
                                hours,Unregistered in vulgar fame, you haveLuxuriously picked out. For I am sure,Though you can guess what temperance should be,You know not what it is.                                                Wherefore is
                                this?To let a fellow that will take rewardsAnd say “God quit you!” be familiar withMy playfellow, your hand, this kingly sealAnd plighter of high hearts! Oh, that I wereUpon the hill of Basan, to outroarThe hornèd herd! For I have savage cause,And to proclaim it civilly were likeA haltered neck which does the hangman thankFor being yare about him.                                                   Is he
                                whipped?Soundly, my lord.Cried he? And begged he pardon?He did ask favor.#LBSFORGOLDOh, has it come to this?You were a cold crumb on dead Julius Caesar’s plate when I met
                                you. No, you were one of Gneius Pompey’s leftovers—not to mention
                                your other, more depraved affairs, which have somehow managed to
                                avoid becoming the subject of vulgar gossip. For I’m sure that
                                although you may know what temperance is, you’ve never experienced
                                it firsthand.Why are you doing this?To let a servant be familiar with my little toy, your hand—a hand
                                that has signed royal treaties and pledged your love to me—oh, if
                                only I were standing on the hill of Basanhome to herds of bulls (traditional symbols of men with adulterous wives), according to the BibleBasan, so that I could roar
                                louder than that horned herd! For I have been savagely abused, and
                                to state my grievances politely would be as absurd as a condemned
                                criminal thanking the hangman for doing his job quickly.Has he been whipped?Soundly, my lord.Did he cry? Did he beg my pardon?He did ask for mercy.
