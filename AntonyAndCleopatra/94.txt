                                shall,As I conceive the journey, be at the MountBefore you, Lepidus.                                          Your way is
                                shorter.My purposes do draw me much about.You’ll win two days upon me.                                                         Sir, good
                                success.Farewell.#LBSFORGOLDDon’t spend any more time here. Go tell your generals to hurry
                                their preparations.Sir, we’ll follow as soon as Mark Antony kisses Octavia
                                good-bye.Good-bye then, until the time I see you dressed in your battle
                                gear, which will suit you both very well.According to my reckoning, we’ll get to Mt. Misena before you,
                                Lepidus. You’re taking a shorter route. My plans take me a roundabout way.
                                You’ll get there two days before me. Good luck, sir.Farewell.
