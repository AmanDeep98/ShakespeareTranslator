                                                  Thanks to my
                                lord.The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,Your reconciler! Wars ’twixt you twain would
                                beAs if the world should cleave, and that slain menShould solder up the rift.When it appears to you where this begins,Turn your displeasure that way, for our faultsCan never be so equal that your loveCan equally move with them. Provide your going;Choose your own company and command what costYour heart has mind to.#LBSFORGOLDThank you, my lord. May the god of power make me, the weakest of
                                the weak, your mediator. A war between you two would split the very
                                world, and the bodies of your slaughtered soldiers would have to
                                fill the chasm between.When you find out who started this disagreement, turn your anger
                                upon them. Our faults can’t be so alike that you would judge us
                                similarly. Order supplies for your trip and choose your traveling
                                companions. Spend as much as you like.
