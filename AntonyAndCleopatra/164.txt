Contemning Rome, he has done all this and moreIn Alexandria. Here’s the manner of ’t:I’ th’ marketplace, on a tribunal silvered,Cleopatra and himself in chairs of goldWere publicly enthroned. At the feet satCaesarion, whom they call my father’s son,And all the unlawful issue that their lustSince then hath made between them.

SheIn th’ habiliments of the goddess IsisThat day appeared, and oft before gave audience,As ’tis reported, so.Let Rome be thus informed.Who, queasy with his insolence already,Will their good thoughts call from him. #LBSFORGOLDIn Alexandria he condemned Rome, and that’s not all. This is what
                                happened: he and Cleopatra sat on chairs of gold on a silver-covered
                                stage in the marketplace. Caesarion—whom they call my father’s son—Julius Caesar was Octavius Caesar’s adopted father (biologically, he was his uncle).Caesarion—whom they call my father’s
                                son—and all their illegitimate children sat at their feet. Antony
                                confirmed her possession of Egypt and made her absolute Queen of
                                lower Syria, Cyprus, and Lydia. He did this in public?In the public arena, where they perform sporting events. He
                                proclaimed his sons to be kings of kings. He gave Media, Parthia,
                                and Armenia to Alexander. He gave Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia to
                                Ptolemy. Cleopatra was dressed like the goddess Isis. They say she
                                often attended her public functions like that. Let’s send this news to Rome.The Roman people are fed up with his arrogance already. They’ll
                                abandon him completely when they hear this.
