Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure readThe garboils she awaked, at the last, best,See when and where she died.                                                          O most
                                false love!Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fillWith sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,In Fulvia’s death how mine received shall be.Quarrel no more, but be prepared to knowThe purposes I bear, which are or ceaseAs you shall give th’ advice. By the fireThat quickens Nilus’ slime, I go from henceThy soldier, servant, making peace or warAs thou affects.Cut my lace, Charmian, come!But let it be. I am quickly ill, and well,So Antony loves.My precious Queen, forbear,And give true evidence to his love which standsAn honorable trial.So Fulvia told me.I prithee, turn aside and weep for her.Then bid adieu to me, and say the tearsBelong to Egypt. Good now, play one sceneOf excellent dissembling, and let it lookLike perfect honor.#LBSFORGOLDLook at this. Take your royal time and read about the quarrels she
                                encouraged. And saving the best for last, read when and where she
                                died.Oh, unfaithful lover! You should be filling vials with your tears.Ancient Romans often placed vials of tears inside their friends’ funerary urns.You should be filling vials with your tears.
                                Seeing how you take Fulvia’s death, I can see how you would react to
                                mine. Stop arguing and listen to my plans. Whether I go ahead with them
                                or not is completely up to you. I swear by the sun that when I leave
                                here, it will be as your faithful servant. I will make either peace
                                or war, whichever you prefer. Cut my corset laces, Charmian, so I can breathe. Hurry! No, leave
                                it alone. I waver easily between sickness and health. Just as Antony
                                loves.Control yourself, my precious Queen, and concede that my love is
                                true. It has endured many genuine trials. That’s what Fulvia told me. I beg you, turn away and cry for her.
                                Then say good-bye to me and tell me those tears were for my benefit.
                                Good. Now perform a scene for me, using your excellent skills of
                                playacting, and pretend that you’re being honorable and righteous.
