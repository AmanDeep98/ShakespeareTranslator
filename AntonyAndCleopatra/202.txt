Let him appear that’s come from Antony.Know you him?                                Caesar, ’tis his
                                schoolmaster—An argument that he is plucked, when hitherHe sends so poor a pinion of his wing,Which had superfluous kings for messengersNot many moons gone by.                                                     Approach and
                                speak.Such as I am, I come from Antony.I was of late as petty to his endsAs is the morn-dew on the myrtle leafTo his grand sea.                                  Be ’t so. Declare thine
                                office.Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, andRequires to live in Egypt; which not granted,He lessens his requests, and to thee suesTo let him breathe between the heavens and earthA private man in Athens. This for him.Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness,Submits her to thy might, and of thee cravesThe circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,Now hazarded to thy grace.#LBSFORGOLDLet the envoy from Antony come in. Do you know him?It’s Antony’s schoolmaster. By sending such an insignificant
                                emissary, Antony shows us how low he has sunk. Not so long ago, he
                                had so many royal supporters that he sent along extra kings as
                                messengers.Come forward and speak.Humble as I am, I represent Antony. Until recently, I was as
                                unimportant to his affairs as the morning dew is to the wide ocean.
                            So be it. Say what you’re here for.He acknowledges that you are the master of his fate, and he
                                requests to be allowed to live in Egypt. If that is not granted, he
                                reduces his requests and asks only that he be allowed to live as a
                                private man in Athens. That’s all he asks for himself. Cleopatra
                                recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority. She only asks
                                that the crown of Egypt pass to her heirs, who are now at your
                                mercy.
