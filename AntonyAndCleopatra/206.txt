                                rangesFrighted each other? Why should he follow?The itch of his affection should not thenHave nicked his captainship at such a pointWhen half to half the world opposed, he beingThe merèd question. ’Twas a shame no lessThan was his loss, to course your flying flagsAnd leave his navy gazing.                                                    Prithee,

) To the boy Caesar send this grizzled
                                head,And he will fill thy wishes to the brimWith principalities.#LBSFORGOLDWhat are we going to do, Enobarbus?Think about our situation, then die.Who is to blame for this: Antony or I?Only Antony was at fault. He put his desire in charge of his
                                reason. So what if you ran from the battle, terrified, as ranks of
                                ships threatened one another? Why should he have followed you? With
                                half the world opposing the other half, it wasn’t the time for
                                Antony, the pivotal player, to let love distract him. To race after
                                your departing ships, leaving his navy to watch, was a shame as
                                great as the resulting loss. Please, let’s not talk about it.Is that his answer?Yes, my lord.The Queen will be treated fairly if she gives me up? That’s what he says.Tell her. (to
