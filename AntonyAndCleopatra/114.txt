                                thenI came before you here a man preparedTo take this offer, but Mark AntonyPut me to some impatience. (to 
ANTONY
)—Though I loseThe praise of it by telling, you must know,When Caesar and your brother were at blows,Your mother came to Sicily and did findHer welcome friendly.
          (to
                                    
POMPEY
)        I have heard it,
                                Pompey,And am well studied for a liberal thanksWhich I do owe you.                                          Let me have your
                                hand.I did not think, sir, to have met you here.The beds i’ th’ East are soft, and thanks to
                                you,That called me timelier than my purpose hither,For I have gained by ’t.
          (to
                                    
POMPEY
)          Since I saw you lastThere’s a change upon you.                                                       Well, I
                                know notWhat counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face,But in my bosom shall she never comeTo make my heart her vassal.#LBSFORGOLDYou should know that when I came here I was prepared to accept
                                your offer. But Mark Antony made me somewhat angry. (to
                                    
ANTONY
) Though it would be nobler to for me
                                not to speak of this good act myself, you should know that when
                                Caesar and your brother were fighting, your mother came to Sicily
                                for refuge. I welcomed her gladly. 
(to
                                    
POMPEY
) I heard what you did for her,
                                Pompey, and want to give you the many thanks I owe you. Let me shake your hand.I didn’t think I would see you here.The East is very seductive. I have you to thank for my trip here;
                                I wouldn’t have left Egypt otherwise, and I have benefited from
                                it.
(to
                                    
POMPEY
) You’ve changed since the last time I
                                saw you.Well, I cannot tell how my difficult life has weathered my face,
                                but I will never let those difficulties subdue my courage.
