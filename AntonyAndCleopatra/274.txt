Yet they are not joined. Where yond pine does standI shall discover all. I’ll bring thee wordStraight how ’tis like to go.                                                       Swallows
                                have builtIn Cleopatra’s sails their nests. The auguriesSay they know not, they cannot tell, look
                                grimly,And dare not speak their knowledge. AntonyIs valiant and dejected, and by startsHis fretted fortunes give him hope and fearOf what he has and has not.                                                        All is
                                lost!This foul Egyptian hath betrayèd me.My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonderThey cast their caps up and carouse togetherLike friends long lost. Triple-turned whore! ’Tis thouHast sold me to this novice, and my heartMakes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly,For when I am revenged upon my charm,I have done all. Bid them all fly. Begone!#LBSFORGOLDThey still haven’t joined the battle. I’ll be able to see better
                                from that pine tree over there. I’ll let you know right away how
                                it’s going.Swallows have built nests in Cleopatra’s sails. The fortunetellers
                                won’t say whether that’s a good sign or a bad one, but they don’t
                                look happy. Antony is valiant and dejected. His mood changes by fits
                                and starts; his checkered luck vacillates between hope and fear,
                                winning and losing. All is lost! This treacherous Egyptian has betrayed me. My fleet
                                has surrendered to the enemy. You can see them over there throwing
                                their hats up in the air and drinking together like long lost
                                friends. Three-time traitor and whore! It’s you who have sold me to
                                this youth, Caesar. Now my war is only with you. Tell the army to
                                flee. Revenge on Cleopatra will be my last act. Order them to
                                escape. Go!
