                             Noblest of men, woo’t die?Hast thou no care of me? Shall I abideIn this dull world, which in thy absence isNo better than a sty? O see, my women,The crown o’ th’ earth doth melt. My lord!Oh, withered is the garland of the war.The soldier’s pole is fall’n! Young boys and girlsAre level now with men. The odds is gone,And there is nothing left remarkableBeneath the visiting moon.                                                 Oh, quietness,
                                lady!She’s dead too, our sovereign.Lady!Madam!O madam, madam, madam!Royal Egypt, Empress!Peace, peace, Iras.No more but e’en a woman, and commandedBy such poor passion as the maid that milksAnd does the meanest chares. It were for meTo throw my scepter at the injurious gods,To tell them that this world did equal theirsTill they had stolen our jewel. All’s but naught.Patience is sottish, and impatience doesBecome a dog that’s mad. Then is it sinTo rush into the secret house of deathEre death dare come to us? How do you, women?What, what, good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian?My noble girls! Ah, women, women! Look,Our lamp is spent, it’s out. Good sirs, take heart.We’ll bury him, and then, what’s brave, what’s noble,Let’s do ’t after the high Roman fashionAnd make death proud to take us. Come, away.This case of that huge spirit now is cold.Ah, women, women! Come. We have no friendBut resolution, and the briefest end.#LBSFORGOLDMost noble man, will you die? Don’t you care about me? Shall I
                                stay in this dreary world, which is no better than a pigsty without
                                you? Oh, look, ladies. The best of the world disappears. My lord!
                            Oh, the glory of war has faded. The flags have fallen. Young boys
                                and girls are equal to men. There is nothing distinctive, nothing
                                remarkable left in the world.Oh, stay calm, lady!Our Queen is dead too.Lady!Madam!Oh, madam, madam, madam!Royal Egypt, Empress!Quiet, quiet, Iras.Now I am no more than a woman, ruled by the same lowly passion as
                                the maid who milks and does the humblest chores. I might now hurl my
                                scepter at the destructive gods and tell them that this earthly
                                world was as good as their heavenly one, until they stole away its
                                jewel, Antony. Now all is for nothing. Patience is foolish.
                                Impatience suits a mad dog. So why should it be a sin to rush toward
                                death, to seek it out in its hiding place before it dares to come to
                                find me? How are you, my ladies? Tell me! Cheer up! How are you,
                                Charmian? My gallant girls! Ah, ladies, look: the light of our lives
                                has gone out. Good noble ladies, be brave. We’ll bury him, and then
                                we’ll commit acts as brave and fine as any Romans, and make death
                                proud to take us. Come on, you can go. The container of that great
                                soul is now cold. Ah, ladies, ladies! Let’s go. We have no friends
                                but determination and the quickest death.#LBSFORGOLD
