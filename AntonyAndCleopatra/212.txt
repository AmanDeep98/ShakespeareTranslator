                                                                               Oh!The scars upon your honor therefore heDoes pity as constrainèd blemishes,Not as deserved.                                 He is a god and knowsWhat is most right. Mine honor was not yielded,But conquered merely.                                (aside) To be sure of that,I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leakyThat we must leave thee to thy sinking, forThy dearest quit thee.                                            Shall I say to
                                CaesarWhat you require of him? For he partly begsTo be desired to give. It much would please himThat of his fortunes you should make a staffTo lean upon. But it would warm his spiritsTo hear from me you had left AntonyAnd put yourself under his shroud,The universal landlord.                                               What’s your
                                name?My name is Thidias.                                          Most kind
                                messenger,Say to great Caesar this in deputation:I kiss his conqu’ring hand. Tell him I am promptTo lay my crown at ’s feet, and there to kneel.Tell him, from his all-obeying breath I hearThe doom of Egypt.#LBSFORGOLDOh!So he regrets that any dishonorable acts were forced on you, not
                                being performed of your own free will. He is like a god and knows the truth. My honor wasn’t given; it
                                was only dominated. 
(aside) I’ll go
                                get the truth of this from Antony. Sir, sir, are you so badly off
                                that we must abandon you to your fate? Even your dearest friend has
                                abandoned you.Shall I tell Caesar what you request from him? He almost begs for
                                the opportunity to help you. It would please him very much if you
                                would rely on his wealth and success to support you. But he would
                                feel even better if I could tell him that you had left Antony and
                                put yourself under his protection. What’s your name?My name is Thidias.Most kind messenger, tell great Caesar that through his deputy I
                                kiss his conquering hand. Tell him I am ready to lay my crown at his
                                feet and kneel before him. Tell him—whose decrees are obeyed by the
                                whole world—that I will accept the fate he chooses for Egypt.
