Good madam, keep yourself within yourself.The man is innocent.Some innocents ’scape not the thunderbolt.Melt Egypt into Nile, and kindly creaturesTurn all to serpents. Call the slave again.Though I am mad, I will not bite him. Call!He is afeard to come.                                          I will not hurt
                                him.These hands do lack nobility that they strikeA meaner than myself, since I myselfHave given myself the cause.                                                         Come
                                hither, sir.Though it be honest, it is never goodTo bring bad news. Give to a gracious messageAn host of tongues, but let ill tidings tellThemselves when they be felt.I have done my duty.Is he married?I cannot hate thee worser than I doIf thou again say “yes.”                                             He’s married,
                                madam.#LBSFORGOLDGood madam, restrain yourself. The man hasn’t done anything
                                wrong.Even innocents cannot always escape disaster. May Egypt drown in
                                the Nile and all good creatures turn into poisonous snakes. Call
                                that servant back. Even though I’m mad, I won’t bite him. Call
                                him!He’s afraid to come in.I won’t hurt him. My hands are tainted if they hit an inferior,
                                especially since I myself am the cause of my own distress.Come here, sir. It may be honest, but it’s never wise to bring bad
                                news. You can give good news in many ways, but let bad news
                                interpret itself as you tell it. I’ve only done my duty.Is he married? I can’t hate you any more than I already do if you
                                repeat that he is. He’s married, madam.
