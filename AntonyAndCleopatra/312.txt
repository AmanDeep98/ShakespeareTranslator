                                is urgent. Let’s hear what he has to say. (to 
EGYPTIAN
) Who are you? A poor Egyptian, but my mistress, the Queen, sent me to find out
                                what your intentions are concerning her. She’s locked up in her tomb
                                and wants to prepare herself for her fate. Tell her to put her mind at rest. She’ll find out soon enough by
                                one of our messengers how respectfully and kindly we plan to treat
                                her. I cannot be taught how to be cruel. May the gods bless you.Come here, Proculeius. Tell her we mean her no disrespect. Give
                                her whatever assurances you feel she needs to keep her from killing
                                herself. I need her alive, so that I can exhibit her in my triumphal
                                procession and gain eternal fame. Go, and hurry back to bring us her
                                reply and news of her state of mind.
