That’s my brave lord!I will be treble-sinewed, -hearted, -breathed,And fight maliciously. For when mine hoursWere nice and lucky, men did ransom livesOf me for jests; but now I’ll set my teethAnd send to darkness all that stop me. Come,Let’s have one other gaudy night. Call to meAll my sad captains. Fill our bowls once more.Let’s mock the midnight bell.                                                           It is
                                my birthday.I had thought t’ have held it poor; but since my lordIs Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.We will yet do well.

                                lord. Do so. We’ll speak to them, and tonight I’ll forceThe wine peep through their scars.—Come on, my Queen,There’s sap in ’t yet. The next time I do
                                fightI’ll make Death love me, for I will contendEven with his pestilent scythe.Now he’ll outstare the lightning. To be furiousIs to be frighted out of fear, and in that moodThe dove will peck the estridge; and I see
                                stillA diminution in our captain’s brainRestores his heart. When valor preys on reason,It eats the sword it fights with. I will seekSome way to leave him.#LBSFORGOLDThat’s my brave lord!I’ll be triple the soldier I was in strength, bravery, and
                                stamina. I’ll fight brutally. In the days when I had better luck,
                                prisoners of war could buy their freedoms from me with simple
                                trinkets. But now I’ll grit my teeth and kill anyone who tries to
                                stop me. Come, let’s have one more extravagant night. Invite all my
                                sad captains. Fill our wine bowls again. Let’s drink through
                                midnight.It’s my birthday. I had planned to celebrate it quietly, but since
                                my lord is once more himself, I will be Cleopatra again.We’ll win yet.

) Call all my lord’s noble captains to
                                him.Do so. I’ll speak to them, and then tonight I’ll get them all so
                                drunk that the wine seeps out of their old war wounds. Come on, my
                                Queen. There’s still life in our cause. The next time I fight, I’ll
                                make Death love me. I’ll compete even with his fatal scythe.Now he’ll work himself up to a fury. Rage scares away a man’s
                                fear. In that state, a dove will attack an ostrich. I have always
                                noticed that when my captain’s reason is diminished, his bravery
                                increases. When courage consumes reason, it destroys its only
                                weapon. I’ll look for some way to leave his service.#LBSFORGOLD
