If the great gods be just, they shall assistThe deeds of justest men.                                                  Know, worthy
                                Pompey,That what they do delay, they not deny. Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decaysThe thing we sue for.                                          We, ignorant of
                                ourselves,Beg often our own harms, which the wise powersDeny us for our good, so find we profitBy losing of our prayers.                                                I shall do
                                well.The people love me, and the sea is mine.My powers are crescent, and my auguring hopeSays it will come to th’ full. Mark AntonyIn Egypt sits at dinner, and will makeNo wars without doors. Caesar gets money whereHe loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both,Of both is flattered, but he neither loves,Nor either cares for him.                                                Caesar and
                                LepidusAre in the field. A mighty strength they carry.Where have you this? ’Tis false.#LBSFORGOLDIf the great gods are just, they will help the most honest
                                men.You should know, noble Pompey, that although the gods may delay
                                action, that doesn’t mean they will necessarily refuse their
                                help.But while we pray and wait for that help, the cause we petition
                                for may be lost.Sometimes we don’t know what’s best for us and ask for things that
                                may harm us. In that case, the wise gods deny our prayers for our
                                own good. I’ll do well. The people are on my side, and I’m in charge of the
                                sea. My forces are growing, and everything I know tells me it’s all
                                coming together. Mark Antony is at dinner in Egypt and won’t be
                                going outside to make war. Caesar loses supporters wherever he
                                raises money. Lepidus flatters both of them, as they flatter him,
                                but he doesn’t love them, and they don’t love him. Caesar and Lepidus are organizing their military operation. They
                                have a massive army.Where did you hear this? It’s not true.
